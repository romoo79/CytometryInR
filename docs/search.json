If you retained the same project organization structure we had during Week #2, it may look similar to the following:\n\nPathToDataFolder &lt;- file.path(\"data\")\n\n\nPathToDataFolder\n\n[1] \"data\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocate .fcs files\nWe will now locate our .fcs files. As we saw last week, our computer will need the full file.paths to these individual files, so we will set the list.files() “full.names” argument to TRUE.\n\nfcs_files &lt;- list.files(PathToDataFolder, pattern=\".fcs\", full.names=TRUE)\nfcs_files\n\n[1] \"data/CellCounts4L_AB_05_ND050_05.fcs\"\n\n\nBy contrast, if the “full.names” argument was set to FALSE, we would have retrieved just the file names\n\nlist.files(PathToDataFolder, pattern=\".fcs\", full.names=FALSE)\n\n[1] \"CellCounts4L_AB_05_ND050_05.fcs\"\n\n\nThis would have been the equivalent of running the basename function on the “full.names=TRUE” output.\n\nbasename(fcs_files)\n\n[1] \"CellCounts4L_AB_05_ND050_05.fcs\"",

    "text": "flowFrame\nFor read.FCS(), it accepts several arguments. The argument “filename” is where we provide our file.path to .fcs file that we wish to load into R. Let’s go ahead and do so\n\nread.FCS(filename=firstfile)\n\nPlease note, if you are doing this with your own .fcs files, you will need to provide two additional arguments, “transformation” = FALSE, and “truncate_max_range” = FALSE for the files to be read in correctly. We will revisit the reasons why in Week #5.\n\nread.FCS(filename=firstfile, transformation = FALSE, truncate_max_range = FALSE)\n\nflowFrame object 'CellCounts4L_AB_05-ND050-05.fcs'\nwith 100 cells and 61 observables:\n       name   desc     range  minRange  maxRange\n$P1    Time     NA    272140         0    272139\n$P2   UV1-A     NA   4194304      -111   4194303\n$P3   UV2-A     NA   4194304      -111   4194303\n$P4   UV3-A     NA   4194304      -111   4194303\n$P5   UV4-A     NA   4194304      -111   4194303\n...     ...    ...       ...       ...       ...\n$P57   R4-A     NA   4194304      -111   4194303\n$P58   R5-A     NA   4194304      -111   4194303\n$P59   R6-A     NA   4194304      -111   4194303\n$P60   R7-A     NA   4194304      -111   4194303\n$P61   R8-A     NA   4194304      -111   4194303\n476 keywords are stored in the 'description' slot\n\n\nIn this case, we can see the .fcs file has been read into R as a “flowFrame” object. We can also see the file name, as well as details about the number of cells, and number of columns (whether detectors (for raw spectral flow data) or fluorophores (for unmixed spectral flow data)).\n\nDirectly below we see what resembles a table. At first glance, the only column with an immediately discernable purpose is the one with the name column, which is listing the detectors present on a Cytek Aurora.\n\nAnd finally, at the bottom we reach a line that tells us that for this .fcs files, 599 keyword can be found in a description slot.\n\n\n\nSo let’s get our bearings, we have loaded in an .fcs file to R, but let’s use some of the concepts we covered last week to try to understand a bit about what type or class of object we are working with. From the output, we saw the words flowFrame object, so let’s read it back in again, but assign it to an variable/object called flowFrame so that we can use the type-discerning functions we worked with last week on.\n\nflowFrame &lt;- read.FCS(filename=firstfile, transformation = FALSE, truncate_max_range = FALSE)\n\nAs we create this variable, if we have the session tab selected on our right secondary side bar, we see it appear:\n\nIf we were to use the type-determining functions we learned last week\n\nclass(flowFrame)\n\n[1] \"flowFrame\"\nattr(,\"package\")\n[1] \"flowCore\"\n\n\nflowFrames are a class of object with a structure defined within the flowCore package. They are used to work with the data contained within individual .fcs files. Looking again at the right secondary side bar, we can see that it shows up as a ““S4 class flowFrame package flowCore”“” with 3 slots, with the words flowFrame adjacent to it.\nA perfectly valid first reaction to first reading this is “well how should I know what any of this means?”. Powering through this initial discomfort, let’s go ahead and click on the dropdown arrow next to the variables name and see if we get any additional clarity on the issue.\n\nWhen we do so, three additional drop-downs appear. Based on the previous line that mentioned 3 slots, we could infer that each line corresponds to one of those slots.\nWhat we are encountering with flowFrame is our first example of an S4 object type. These more-complicated object types are quite common for the various Bioconductor affilitated R packages.\nThese objects will usually appear with either S4 or S3 in their metadata, and are made up of various simpler object types that are cobbled together within the larger object, usually occupying individual slots.\nWhat advantage this bundling provides will be something we revisit throughout the course as you encounter more of these S4/S3 objects.\n\n\n\nexprs\nThe first slot within the flowFrame object shows up with the name “exprs”. For the exprs object, glancing at it’s middle column, we can based on the 100 rows and 61 columns, that it is likely a matrix-style object. We might also recall we saw similar numbers in the printed output when we ran read.FCS()earlier.\n\nWhich likely means that “exprs” slot is where the MFI data for the individual acquired cells within our .fcs file is being stored. Within Positron, for a matrix object, we can click on the little grid symbol on the far right to open up the table within editor.\n\nIf we utilize the scroll bars, we can see that the individual detectors (in the case of uploading a raw spectral fcs file, they would appear as fluorophores for unmixed spectral or conventional fcs files) occupy the individual columns, which are named. The rows are not named, but number 100, matching the number of cells present in the .fcs file. Additionally, on the far left there is a little summary table about the overall data.\n\nLet’s go ahead and assign this matrix to a new variable/object so that we can explore it later. Since flowFrame is an S4 object, it’s slots can be individually accessed by adding the @ symbol and the respective slot name.\n\nMFI_Matrix &lt;- flowFrame@exprs\n\nAlternatively, we can use the Bioconductor helper function exprs() to get data held in that slot\n\nMFI_Matrix_Alternate &lt;- exprs(flowFrame)\n\nIn the case of the above, this displayed text output to the console would be unwiedly to display all at once.

If we recall, we saw something similar in the first output column when we first ran read.FCS().\n\nLets break out the str() and class() functions from last week and see what we can find out about why this is occuring.\n\nstr(ColumnNames)\n\n Named chr [1:61] \"Time\" \"UV1-A\" \"UV2-A\" \"UV3-A\" \"UV4-A\" \"UV5-A\" \"UV6-A\" ...\n - attr(*, \"names\")= chr [1:61] \"$P1N\" \"$P2N\" \"$P3N\" \"$P4N\" ...\n\n\nIn this case we can see that we don’t just have a vector (list) similar to what we saw with Fluorophores object last week, because instead of a chr [1:61] we get back a Named chr [1:61] designation. What we see is that in this case, each value has a corresponding index name as well. (ex. $P1N, $P2N, etc.) Let’s double check with class() function.\n\nclass(ColumnNames)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nWe can see that everything is character, but it doesn’t inform us that each index was named. This is one of the reasons it is best when trying to see what type of an object something is, to use multiple functions, to avoid missing some important details.\nIf we were trying to remove the names, being left with just the values (similar to what we saw with the vector-style list last week), we could use the unname() function:\n\nunname(ColumnNames)\n\n [1] \"Time\"    \"UV1-A\"   \"UV2-A\"   \"UV3-A\"   \"UV4-A\"   \"UV5-A\"   \"UV6-A\"  \n [8] \"UV7-A\"   \"UV8-A\"   \"UV9-A\"   \"UV10-A\"  \"UV11-A\"  \"UV12-A\"  \"UV13-A\" \n[15] \"UV14-A\"  \"UV15-A\"  \"UV16-A\"  \"SSC-H\"   \"SSC-A\"   \"V1-A\"    \"V2-A\"   \n[22] \"V3-A\"    \"V4-A\"    \"V5-A\"    \"V6-A\"    \"V7-A\"    \"V8-A\"    \"V9-A\"   \n[29] \"V10-A\"   \"V11-A\"   \"V12-A\"   \"V13-A\"   \"V14-A\"   \"V15-A\"   \"V16-A\"  \n[36] \"FSC-H\"   \"FSC-A\"   \"SSC-B-H\" \"SSC-B-A\" \"B1-A\"    \"B2-A\"    \"B3-A\"   \n[43] \"B4-A\"    \"B5-A\"    \"B6-A\"    \"B7-A\"    \"B8-A\"    \"B9-A\"    \"B10-A\"  \n[50] \"B11-A\"   \"B12-A\"   \"B13-A\"   \"B14-A\"   \"R1-A\"    \"R2-A\"    \"R3-A\"   \n[57] \"R4-A\"    \"R5-A\"    \"R6-A\"    \"R7-A\"    \"R8-A\"   \n\n\n\n\nLet’s return to the right sidebar to continue our exploration, by clicking on the dropdown arrow for exprs in the side-bar\n\nThe output is less user-friendly than what we saw when clicking on the little grid. If we scroll down far enough, we get down as far as [,61], which corresponds to the total number of columns.\n\nIn base R, column order can be defined by placing the corresponding column index number after a comma “,”.

Click that drop-down arrow!\n\nHaving survived our charge into the unknown, the four parameter slots appear to be “varMetadata”, “data”, “dimLabels” and “._classVersion_”.\n\n\nvarMetadata\nFortunately for us, both “varMetadata” and “data” at least appear to be table-like objects of a type known as a “data.frame”, so lets click on the grid to open in our editor window.\nIn the case of varMetadata, we seem to have retrieved a column of metadata names.\n\nThese look reminiscent of what we saw at the top of the read.FCS() column outputs previously\n\n\n\ndata\nClicking on the grid for parameters’s data slot will end opening the actual content that was displayed.\n\nLet’s try to retrieve the data contained within this slot and save it as it’s own variable/object within our R session. First, we need to open flowFrame object, then use @ to get inside its parameters slot. Since parameters is also a complex object (AnnotatedDataFrame specifically), we will need to use another @ to get inside its data slot:\n\nParameterData &lt;- flowFrame@parameters@data\n\nhead(ParameterData, 10)\n\n      name desc   range   minRange maxRange\n$P1   Time &lt;NA&gt;  272140    0.00000   272139\n$P2  UV1-A &lt;NA&gt; 4194304 -111.00000  4194303\n$P3  UV2-A &lt;NA&gt; 4194304 -111.00000  4194303\n$P4  UV3-A &lt;NA&gt; 4194304 -111.00000  4194303\n$P5  UV4-A &lt;NA&gt; 4194304 -111.00000  4194303\n$P6  UV5-A &lt;NA&gt; 4194304 -111.00000  4194303\n$P7  UV6-A &lt;NA&gt; 4194304 -111.00000  4194303\n$P8  UV7-A &lt;NA&gt; 4194304  -26.34649  4194303\n$P9  UV8-A &lt;NA&gt; 4194304 -111.00000  4194303\n$P10 UV9-A &lt;NA&gt; 4194304    0.00000  4194303\n\n\nAnd similarly, we could access with the Bioconductor helper function parameters(), but we would need to specify the accessor for data outside the parenthesis.\n\nParameterData_Alternate &lt;- parameters(flowFrame)@data\n\nIf we ran the str() function, we get the following insight into ParameterData’s object type\n\nstr(ParameterData)\n\n'data.frame':   61 obs. of  5 variables:\n $ name    : 'AsIs' Named chr  \"Time\" \"UV1-A\" \"UV2-A\" \"UV3-A\" ...\n  ..- attr(*, \"names\")= chr [1:61] \"$P1N\" \"$P2N\" \"$P3N\" \"$P4N\" ...\n $ desc    : 'AsIs' Named chr  NA NA NA NA ...\n  ..- attr(*, \"names\")= chr [1:61] NA NA NA NA ...\n $ range   : num  272140 4194304 4194304 4194304 4194304 ...\n $ minRange: num  0 -111 -111 -111 -111 ...\n $ maxRange: num  272139 4194303 4194303 4194303 4194303 ...\n\n\nWe can see this class of object is a “data.frame”. This is one of the more common object types in R, and we will be seeing these extensively throughout the course. We see that each of the columns appears to be designated by a $ followed by the column name, and then type of column (numeric, character, etc).\n\nIf we are trying to see these columns in R, we notice that data.frame is not like the previous S4 class objets we interacted with, as the @ symbol after doesn’t bring up any suggestions\n\nParameterData@\n\nBy contrast, adding the $ we saw when using the str() function does retrieve the underlying information\n\nParameterData$\n\n\nAs you become more familiar with R, remembering to check what kind of object you are working with, and how to access the contents will with practice become more familiar to you.\nSimilar to what we saw with a matrix, we can subset a data.frame based on the column or row index using square brackets [].\n\nParameterData[,1]\n\n     $P1N      $P2N      $P3N      $P4N      $P5N      $P6N      $P7N      $P8N \n   \"Time\"   \"UV1-A\"   \"UV2-A\"   \"UV3-A\"   \"UV4-A\"   \"UV5-A\"   \"UV6-A\"   \"UV7-A\" \n     $P9N     $P10N     $P11N     $P12N     $P13N     $P14N     $P15N     $P16N \n  \"UV8-A\"   \"UV9-A\"  \"UV10-A\"  \"UV11-A\"  \"UV12-A\"  \"UV13-A\"  \"UV14-A\"  \"UV15-A\" \n    $P17N     $P18N     $P19N     $P20N     $P21N     $P22N     $P23N     $P24N \n \"UV16-A\"   \"SSC-H\"   \"SSC-A\"    \"V1-A\"    \"V2-A\"    \"V3-A\"    \"V4-A\"    \"V5-A\" \n    $P25N     $P26N     $P27N     $P28N     $P29N     $P30N     $P31N     $P32N \n   \"V6-A\"    \"V7-A\"    \"V8-A\"    \"V9-A\"   \"V10-A\"   \"V11-A\"   \"V12-A\"   \"V13-A\" \n    $P33N     $P34N     $P35N     $P36N     $P37N     $P38N     $P39N     $P40N \n  \"V14-A\"   \"V15-A\"   \"V16-A\"   \"FSC-H\"   \"FSC-A\" \"SSC-B-H\" \"SSC-B-A\"    \"B1-A\" \n    $P41N     $P42N     $P43N     $P44N     $P45N     $P46N     $P47N     $P48N \n   \"B2-A\"    \"B3-A\"    \"B4-A\"    \"B5-A\"    \"B6-A\"    \"B7-A\"    \"B8-A\"    \"B9-A\" \n    $P49N     $P50N     $P51N     $P52N     $P53N     $P54N     $P55N     $P56N \n  \"B10-A\"   \"B11-A\"   \"B12-A\"   \"B13-A\"   \"B14-A\"    \"R1-A\"    \"R2-A\"    \"R3-A\" \n    $P57N     $P58N     $P59N     $P60N     $P61N \n   \"R4-A\"    \"R5-A\"    \"R6-A\"    \"R7-A\"    \"R8-A\" \n\n\nThe individual detectors or fluorophore appear under “name”. For now, based on what we know, the $P# appears to be some sort of name being used as an internal consistent reference to the respective.\n“desc” is appearing empty for this raw spectral fcs file, but if you were to checked an unmixed file, this would be occupied the marker/ligand name assigned to it during the experiment setup.\n“range”, “minRange” and “maxRange” are beyond the scope of today, but are used by both instrument manufacturers and software vendors when setting appropiate scaling for a plot. For the actual details, see the Flow Cytometry Standard documentation.\nHaving exhausted our options under parameters “varMetadata” and “data” slots, let’s continue to the next slot.\n\n\ndimLabels\n\nIn this case, not much is returned. Yey!\n\nflowFrame@parameters@dimLabels\n\n[1] \"rowNames\"    \"columnNames\"\n\n\n\n\nclassVersion\nContinuing on to the last slot “.__classVersion__”\n\nflowFrame@parameters@.__classVersion__\n\nAnnotatedDataFrame \n           \"1.1.0\" \n\n\nAlso mercifully short, both of these seem to be more involved in defining the S4 class object, and don’t contain anything we need to retrieve today.\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nAt this point, we have explored both “exprs” and “parameter” slots for the flowFrame object we created. Let’s tackle the final slot, named description.\n\nWhen doing so, a very large list is opened within the Positron variables window. While we could scroll through it, it might be easier to retrieve certain number of rows via the console to make interpreting this more structured.\n\nTo retrieve the list itself, we would need to access the description slot of the flowFrame object. Since it is a slot, we will need to use the @ accessor.\n\n\nDescriptionList &lt;- flowFrame@description\n\n\nDescriptionList \n\n$`$BEGINANALYSIS`\n[1] \"0\"\n\n$`$BEGINDATA`\n[1]

In our case, we have built an automated InstrumentQC dashboard for all the instruments at our core.\n\n\n\nBy extracting out from our daily QC bead .fcs files the stored N (Detector Name) and V (Gain/Voltage) values for all the individual detectors, it allows us to plot Levey-Jennings Plots for our individual instruments, giving us usually around a months warning before an individual laser begins to fail. This helps with scheduling the Field-Service Engineer visit before it starts impacting the actual data.\n\n\n\nWhile most of the detectors keywords are similar (only changing there individual name and voltage) there are a couple exceptions.\nFor the FSC/SSC parameters, instead of Raw_Fluorescence value for Type, we see the corresponding Scatter value get return. This in term is what is used by various commercial softwares to show those axis as linear instead of biexponential when selected.\n\n\n\nThis is similarly the case for the Time parameter, where in addition to Type being set to Time, the range also appears different to Raw/Scatters value.",

This is the process you will repeat each week throughout the course.\n\nNew Repository\nFirst off, login to your GitHub account. Once there, you will select the options to create a new repository (similar to what you did during Using GitHub)\n\n\n\nFor this week, let’s set this new repository up as a private repository, and call it Week2. This will keep things consistent with the file.paths we will be showing in the examples.\n\n\n\nOnce the new repository has been created, copy the URL.\n\n\n\nNext, open up Positron, set the interpreter to use R, and then select the option to bring in a “New Folder from Git”.\n\n\n\nPaste in your new repository’s url. Additionally, if you want to match file.paths shown in the examples, set your storage location to your local Documents folder (please note the start of the file.path will look differently depending on whether you are on Windows, MacOS, or Linux).\n\n\n\nYour new repository will then be imported from GitHub. Once this is done, create two subfolders (data and images) and a new .qmd file (naming it filepaths.qmd).\n\n\n\n\n\nSync\nWith this done, return to GitHub and open your forked version of the CytometryInR course folder. If you haven’t yet done so, click on sync to bring in this week’s code and datasets.\n\n\n\nReturning to Positron, you will need to switch Project Folders, switching from Week2 over to CytometryInR.\n\n\n\n\n\nPull\nOnce CytometryInR project folder has opened, you will need to pull in the new data from GitHub to your local computer.\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy Files to Week2\nOnce this is done, you will see within the course folder, containing this weeks folder (02_FilePaths). Within it there is a data folder with .fcs files. To avoid causing conflicts when bringing in next week’s materials, you will want to manually copy over these .fcs files (via your File Explorer) to the data folder within your “Week2” Project Folder.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommit and Push\nWhen you reopen your Week2 project folder in Positron, you should now be able to see the .fcs files within the data folder. Next, from the action bar on the far left, select the Source Control tab. Stage all the changes (as was done in Using Git), and write a short commit message.\n\n\n\nWith these files now being tracked by version control, push (ie. send) your changes to GitHub so that they are remotely backed up.\n\n\n\nAnd with this setup complete, you are now ready to proceed. Remember, run code and write notes in your working project folder (Week2 or otherwise named) to avoid conflicts next week in the CytometryInR folder when you are trying to bring in the Week #3 code and datasets.",

    "section": "Variables",
    "text": "Variables\nBefore exploring file paths, we need to have some basic R code knowledge that we can use to work with them. Within R, we have the ability to assign particular values (be they character strings, numbers or logicals) to objects (ie. variables) that can be used when called upon later.\nFor example:\n\nWhatDayDidIWriteThis &lt;- \"Saturday\"\n\nIn this case, the variable name is what the assignment arrow (“&lt;-”) is pointing at. In this case, WhatDayDidIWriteThis\n\n\nWhen we run this, we create a variable, that will appear within the right-sidebar.\n\nWhatDayDidIWriteThis &lt;- \"Saturday\"\n\n\n\n\nThese variables can subsequently be retrieved by printing (ie. running) the name of the variable\n\nWhatDayDidIWriteThis \n\n[1] \"Saturday\"\n\n\n\n\nYou can create variables with almost any name you can think of\n\nTopSecretMeetingDay &lt;- \"Saturday\"\n\n\n\nWith a few exceptions. R doesn’t play well with spaces:\n\nTop Secret Meeting Day &lt;- \"Saturday\"\n\nError in parse(text = input): &lt;text&gt;:1:5: unexpected symbol\n1: Top Secret\n        ^\n\n\n\n\nBut does play well with underscores:\n\nTop_Secret_Meeting_Day &lt;- \"Saturday\"\n\n\n\nThe above (with individual words separated by _) is collectively known as snake case. The alternate way to help delineate variable names is “camelCase”, with first letter of each word being capitalized (seen in the previous example).\n\n\n\n\nTopSecretMeetingDay\n\n[1] \"Saturday\"\n\n\n\n\nYou can overwrite a Variable name by assigning a different value to it:\n\nTopSecretMeetingDay &lt;- \"Monday\"\n\n\nTopSecretMeetingDay\n\n[1] \"Monday\"\n\n\n\n\nYou can also remove individual variables via the rm function\n\nrm(Top_Secret_Meeting_Day)\n\n\n\nOr if trying to remove all, via the right sidebar\n\n\n\nIn the prior case, we are creating a variable that is a “string” of character values, due to our use of “” around the word. We can see this when we use the str() function.\n\nFluorophores &lt;- \"FITC\"\nstr(Fluorophores)\n\n chr \"FITC\"\n\n\nThe “chr” in front denotating that Fluorophores contains a character string.\n\n\nThis could also be retrieved using the class() function.\n\nclass(Fluorophores)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we could assign a numeric value to a variable\n\nFluorophores &lt;- 29\nstr(Fluorophores)\n\n num 29\n\n\nWhich returns “num”, ie. numeric.\n\n\nWe can also specify a logical (ie. True or FALSE) to a particular object\n\nIsPerCPCy5AGoodFluorophore &lt;- FALSE\nstr(IsPerCPCy5AGoodFluorophore)\n\n logi FALSE\n\n\nWhich returns logi in front, denoting this variable contains a logical value.\n\n\nLast week, when we were installing dplyr, the reason that installation failed was install.packages() expects a character string. However, when we left off the ““, it looked within our local environments created variables for the dplyr variable, couldn’t find it, and thus failed.\nWe could of course, have assigned a character value to a variable name, and then used that variable name, which would have worked.\n\nPackageToInstall &lt;- \"dplyr\"\n\ninstall.packages(PackageToInstall)",

This can be due to a number of reasons, ranging from a missing dependency, or an update that caused a conflict. While these can occur for CRAN or Bioconductor packages, they are more frequently seen for GitHub packages where the Description/Namespace files may not have been fully updated yet to install all the required dependencies.\nWhen encountering an error, start of by first reading through the message to see if you can parse any useful information about what package failed to install, and if it list the missing dependency packages name. The later was the case in the error message example shown below."

However, to become comfortable and be able to apply what you have learned, you will need to explore beyond our examples, try it with your own datasets, encounter things that don’t work, and troubleshoot your way through them. It’s this cycle of venturing into the unknown that develops strong coding skills that are needed to overcome any barrier you encounter. The goal of the take-home questions is to provide some less curated problems that will take a little longer to answer to help get you started on your own exploration of the topic."

They contain a .yaml header, followed by a mix of regular written text (often explanations or other documentation), and sections (ie. chunks) that contain code. These are used when we are still getting the code to work, when we need to modify inputs frequently, or simply when we need to document what and why we are doing something to make life easier for our future-self two months from now."

Yes, but we will take the workaround.\nSo, for anyone on Windows or MacOS, download FlowJo v10. Once installed, open the software, and close the login popups. Once there, open the Floreada created FlowJo.wsp file. Since you haven’t logged in, it won’t show any events. But it will correct the formatting bug. Close the software, and return to R. Your Floreada sourced .WSP file should now be readable by CytoML.\nOdd? For sure. Fixable? Likely, I will set a reminder to work with the Floreada and CytoML devs to see if we can cut out the need for this workaround."

    "text": "Cytometry in R: A Course for Beginners\nCytometry in R is a free virtual mini-course being organized by the Flow Cytometry Shared Resource core at the University of Maryland’s Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center. This course is a passion project arising from our desire to contribute back to the community. We are excited that you have chosen to take part and look forward to helping you get started on your own learning journey.\nIf you did not complete the original interest form, and would like to be added to our mailing list, please complete the form here\nThe pre-course learning materials are now available via the Course tab. They consist of walkthroughs of how to set up your workstations with the required software, and exercises to help you become more familiar with the various teaching and coding resources we will be using throughout the course.\n\n\n\nWorkstation Setup\n\nWeek 1: February 2, 2026 During this first session, we will ensure that everyone’s computer gets properly setup, as well as start building individual participants familiarity with the software infrastructure that they will be using throughout the rest of the course. Namely, you will need to install R, Rtools, Positron, Quarto, and Git; as well as setup and link to a GitHub account. This session also touches on concepts behind version control and how to install R package from the various repositories (CRAN, Bioconductor, GitHub).\n \n\n\nFile Paths\n\nWeek 2: February 9, 2026 For this session, we focus on how to programmatically tell your computer where to locate your experimental files, introducing the concept of file paths. We explore how the various operating systems (Linux, MacOS, Windows) specify their respective folders and files, and how to identify where you are currently within the directory. Our goal by the end of this session is to have walked you through how to figure out where an .fcs file of interest is stored, and convey to your computer where you want it copied/moved to, without encountering the common pitfalls.\n \n\n\nInside an .FCS file\n\nWeek 3: February 16, 2026 In the course of this session we will slice into an .FCS file and find out what the individual components that make it up are. In the process, we will cover the concepts of main data structures within R (vectors, matrices, data.frames, list) and how to identify what we are working with. Additionally, we will explore how various cytometry softwares store their metadata variables under various keywords that can be useful to know about.\n \n\n\nIntroduction to the Tidyverse\n\nWeek 4: February 23, 2026 Within this session, we explore how the various tidyverse packages can be utilized to reorganize rows and columns of data in ways that are useful for data analysis. We will primarily work with the MFI expression data we isolated from within the .fcs file in the previous session, identifying and isolating events that meet certain criterias. We introduce the concepts behind “tidy” data and how it can improve our workflows.\n \n\n\nGating Sets\n\nWeek 5: March 2, 2026 As part of this session, we learn about the two main flow cytometry infrastructure packages in R we will be working with during the course, flowcore and flowWorkspace. Throughout the session, we will compare how they differ in naming, memory usage, and accessing .fcs file metadata. We additionally explore how to add keywords to their respective metadata for use in filtering specimens of interest from the larger set of .fcs files.\n \n\n\nVisualizing with ggplot2\n\nWeek 6: March 9, 2026 During this session we provide an introduction to the ggplot2 package. We will take the datasets we have collected from the previous sessions and see how in varying in different arguments at the respective plot layers we can produce and customize many different forms of plots, focusing on both cytometry and statistics plots. We close out providing links to additional helpful resources and highlight the TidyTuesday project.\n \n\n\nApplying Transformations and Compensation\n\nWeek 7: March 16, 2026 For this seventh session, we take a closer look at the raw values of the data within our .fcs files, and explore the various ways to transform (ie. scale) flow cytometry data in R to better visualize “positive” and “negative populations”. In the process, we visualize the differences resulting from applying different transformations commonly used by commercial software. Similarly, we learn how to apply and visualize compensation in context of conventional flow cytometry files.\n \n\n\nManual and Automated Gating\n\nWeek 8: March 23, 2026 Within this session, we explore various ways to implement gating for flow cytometry files in R. We will explore manual approaches utilizing flowGate, as well as automated options with openCyto and it’s gating templates. We additionally will explore how to provide gate constraints and various ways to visually screen and evaluate the outcomes within the context of our own projects.\n \n\n\nConference Break 1\nNo class week of March 30, 2026. If you are attending the ABRF conference, track me down at the Complex Data Analysis in Flow Cytometry: Navigating the Landscape talk on Monday, March 30th at 4:30 PM.\n \n\n\nIt’s Raining Functions!\n\nWeek 9: April 6, 2026 In the course of this ninth session, we tackle one of the harder but most useful concepts to learn for a beginner, namely functions. We explore what they are, how their individual arguments work, how they differ from for-loops, and how to create our own to do useful work, reduce the number times code gets copied and pasted. Additionally, some functional programming best practices will be introduced, as well as provide introduction to how to use the walk and map functions from the purrr package.\n \n\n\nDownsampling and Concatenation\n\nWeek 10: April 13, 2026 Within this session, we will expand on our growing understanding of GatingSets, functions and fcs file internals to write a script to downsample your fcs files to a desired number (or percentage) of cells for a given cell population. We will additionally learn how to concatenate these downsampled files together, and save them to a new .fcs file in ways that the metadata can be read by commercial software without the scaling being widely thrown off.\n \n\n\nRetrieving data for Statistics\n\nWeek 11: April 20, 2026 Leveraging the increased familiarity working with the various packages this far in the course, in this session we will retrieve summary statistics for the gates within our GatingSet, and programmatically derrive out tidy data.frames for use in statistical analyses typically used by many Immunologist. In the process, we add a couple additional plot types to our ggplot2 arsenal to hold in reserve should Prism prices go up again.\n \n\n\nSpectral Signatures\n\nWeek 12: April 27, 2026 As part of this session, we will explore how to extract fluorescent signatures from our raw spectral flow cytometry reference controls. Building on prior concepts, we will learn to isolate median signatures from positive and negative gates, and how to derrive and plot normalized signatures. We also introduce plotly package and it’s interactive plotting features, before showcasing various packages attempts at facilitating signature retrieval.\n \n\n\nSimilarities and Hotspots\n\nWeek 13: May 4, 2026 During this session, we will utilize the spectral signature matrix isolated from raw spectral flow cytometry controls and evaluate different ways of evaluating how similar different fluorescent signatures are to each other. In the process, we will gain better understanding of the metrics behind similarity (cosine), panel complexity (kappa), and unmixing-dependent spreading (collinearity).\n \n\n\nUnmixing in R\n\nWeek 14: May 11, 2026 In the course of this session, we will attempt a reach goal of many, namely carry out unmixing of raw .fcs files using the spectral signatures we have isolated from our unmixing controls, and write to new .fcs files. After evaluating the necessary internals, we will explore how various current cytometry R packages have implemented their own unmixing functions, and the various limitations that each approach has encountered.\n \n\n\nCleaning Algorithms\n\nWeek 15: May 18, 2026 In the span of this session, we will directly compare how various Bioconductor data cleanup algorithms (namely PeacoQC, FlowAI, FlowCut, and FlowClean) tackle distinguishing and removing bad quality events. We will see how they perform with previously identified good quality and horrific quality .fcs files. We will whether the implemented algorithmic decisions made sense, and how to customize them within our workflows to achieve our own desired goals.\n \n\n\nClustering Algorithms\n\nWeek 16: May 25, 2026 As part of this session, we venture away from supervised and semi-supervised analyses to explore unsupervised clustering approaches, namely FlowSOM and Phenograph. We will compare outcomes depending markers included, transformations applied, and panel used to gain a greater familiarity with how they work. We wrap up by investigating ways to visualize marker expression of cells ending up in each cluster, and how to backgate them to our manual gates.\n \n\n\nNormalization: Batch Effect or Real Biology\n\nWeek 17: June 1, 2026 During this session, we will dive into evaluating the performance of two commonly used normalization algorithms, CytoNorm and CyCombine. We will utilize our ggplot2 and functional programming toolkits to create a customized workflow to visualize the differences for our respective cell populations before and after normalization, to better evaluate how the respective parameter choices can affect the process.\n \n\n\nConference Break 2\nNo class week of June 8, 2026. If you are attending the Cyto conference, track me down at my talks and posters.\n \n\n\nDimensionality Visualization\n\nWeek 18: June 15, 2026 For this session, we explore how dimensionality visualization algorithms perform tSNE and UMAP in R using our raw and unmixed samples. In the process, we will explore how markers included, number of cells, and presence of bad quality events can impact the final visualizations. Finally, we will provide an overview of how to link to Python to additionally run PaCMAP and PHATE visualizations for use in R.\n \n\n\nAnnotating Unsupervised Clusters\n\nWeek 19: June 22, 2026 In the course of this session, we explore ways to scale our efficiency in figuring out what an unsupervised cluster of cells may be, by employing several annotation packages. We explore how these work under the hood in their decision making process, and how to link them to reference data from external repositories for additional evaluation.\n \n\n\nThe Art of GitHub Diving\n\nWeek 20: June 29, 2026 Within this session, we delve into the art of investigating a new-to-you GitHub repository. We discuss the overall structure of R packages stored as source files within GitHub repositories, and how to leverage this knowledge when troubleshooting errors thrown by underdocumented R packages. We discuss how to modify identified functions, evaluate them, and process to submit helpful bug reports back to the original project to help fix the issue.\n \n\n\nXML Files All The Way Down\n\nWeek 21: July 6, 2026 Breaking news alert, most of the experiment templates and worksheet layouts we work with as cytometrist are .xml files. In this session, we learn some additional coding tools to allow us to work with these types of files to extract useful data. In this session, we test out our new problem solving abilities to retrieve data from SpectroFlo and Diva .xml files to monitor how our core’s flow cytometers behaved for various users last week.\n \n\n\nUtilizing Bioconductor packages\n\nWeek 22: July 13, 2026 Many of the R packages for Flow Cytometry we have utilized in this course were packages from the Bioconductor project. We take a look at what makes Bioconductor packages unique compared to packages found on GitHub and CRAN, explore some of their specific infrastructure types for flow cytometry data, and highlight some useful packages for downstream analysis that we haven’t had time to properly explore.\n \n\n\nBuilding your First R package\n\nWeek 23: July 20, 2026 For most of the course, we have been working with R packages that other individuals built and maintained. In this session, we leverage all your hard work from the rest of the course and corral the unwieldly arsenal of functions you wrote into your first R package for easier use. We will discuss the individual pieces of an R package, the importance of a well-setup namespace file, and how to generate help page manuals to refer future-you back to what your individual function arguments actually do.\n \n\n\nEveryone Get’s a Quarto Website\n\nWeek 24: July 27, 2026 In this session, we will extend the knowledge of .R and .qmd files you have gained from the course and extend them to create your own website using Quarto. We discuss the additional files that are required, how to customize and render the website locally, and finally set up Quarto Pub or GitHub Pages website that we are to access online.\n \n\n\nReproducibility and Replicability\n\nWeek 25: August 3, 2026 Throughout the course, we emphasized the importance of making your workspaces and code reproducible and replicable. But what do we mean by these terms, and are there best practices we could add to our existing workflow to do this more efficiently? We explore a couple community-led efforts within the cytometry space and troubleshoot their implementation into a previously published pipeline.\n \n\n\nConference Break 3\nNo class week of August 10, 2026. If you are attending the BioC conference, track me down at my talk/poster.\n \n\n\nOpen Source Licenses\n\nWeek 26: August 17, 2026 For this course, we have relied extensively on open-source software to create our own data analysis pipelines. In the process, you may have some recollection of the various license names. But what impact do all these different names have in the end? We take a brief deep-dive into the ecosystem of free and open-source licenses, and evaluate what their respective license terms mean for us as individual users of the code, as well as potential developers extending existing codebases.\n \n\n\nValidating Algorthmic Tools\n\nWeek 27: August 24, 2026 We will be the first to admit, new implementations of algorithms as R packages are awesome! We appreciate the effort that went into them and making them available to the community at large. But what is the best way of evaluating whether they behave as promised, or work for our dataset? During this session, we share tips and tricks to gain better understanding of how a new R package works, and things to watch out for when evaluating complicated algortithms. We wrap with walkthrough of how to generate simulated datasets with known distributions for use in testing.\n \n\n\nDatabases and Repositories\n\nWeek 28: August 31, 2026 During this session, we will learn how to identify and retrieve .fcs files from databases. While many of us are accustomed to working with large datasets of our own making, many of us are increasingly encountering larger-than-memory datasets, as well as files stored in large repositories. In this session, we will explore several database focused R packages, before investigating how to identify and retrieve .fcs files and associated metadata of interest from repositories, namely ImmPort (and maybe FlowRepository if it can be pinged that afternoon).\n \n\n\nAssembling Web Data\n\nWeek 29: September 7, 2026 In this session, we briefly delve into the concepts of web-scraping and APIs in general. We highlight useful packages, namely httr2 and rvest, and best practices implemented to allow respectful retrieval of useful data without crashing someone’s server like some AI startup bot. We finish by providing a list of additional useful resources for those interested in learning more.\n \n\n\nFuture Directions\n\nWeek 30: September 14, 2026 In this final of the planned sessions, we revisit our solutions to the challenge problems set out during the beginning of the course. We also discuss potential future topics to visit in the future, and any additional resources that proved helpful throughout the course.",

    "text": "Cytometry in R is a free weekly mini-course being offered both in-person and online by the Flow Cytometry Shared Resource staff at the University of Maryland Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center. Its primary audience is for those with prior flow cytometry knowledge, who have limited previous experience with the programming language R. However, we welcome everyone regardless of their existing  flow cytometry  or coding experience.\nThis course is a passion project arising from our desire to contribute back to the community. We are excited that so many of you have chosen to sign up, and look forward to helping you get started on your own learning journeys.\nFor more information on topics-covered, please see our schedule.\nIf you did not previously complete the interest form, and would like to be added to our mailing list, please complete the form here\n\n\nAbout\n\n\nMotivation\nWhile many cytometry enthusiast express an interest in learning how to carry out flow cytometry analyses in R, they often do not know where to start. Additionally, many of the limited existing resources are focused towards users with intermediate bioinformatic skills, contributing to a greater barrier for entry for those just starting out. Our motivation in offering this mini-course tailored towards beginners is to make the learning journey smoother than the one we ourselves experienced.\n\nWhile designing the course, we kept the following concepts in mind:\n\nBeginning coders benefit both by having detailed examples that they can initially work through on their own time, as well as less defined problems that through troubleshooting enable the acquisition of the thought-process and skills needed for coding.\nSome topics will take individuals a longer time to fully grasp. Providing a format and resources that enable being able to revisit the material multiple times is incredibly helpful. Likewise, life is busy, and missing a workshop session is highly probable. If this happens, it shouldn’t make or break the ability of the individual to understanding the rest of the course.\nConsistency is key, and being able to apply what you are learning to your own datasets, files, and questions of interest helps achieve this.\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse Details\n\nEach week, the mini-course will cover a particular topic for an hour. This individual class is offered on multiple days, at different times, both in-person and online. We invite you to attend the one that best fits your schedule each week. If life gets busy and you can’t make regular day, the online livestream recordings will be available on YouTube.\n \n\nCourse Materials\n\nWe will release the course materials for the upcoming week on Sundays 2200 EST (Monday 0300 GMT+0) via our course website and GitHub. These materials will normally be Quarto Markdown documents containing code, explanation, and other resources needed for that week. If you have your own data, you can use your own data! If you don’t have any data, we will make sure to provide some of our own available data for each lesson so that you can use it and be able to follow along.\nIn our commitment to open-source and open-science, all teaching materials are freely offered under a CC-BY-SA license, while all code examples are offered under the AGPL3-0 copyleft license.\n \n\n\nIn-Person (Baltimore)\n\nFor those who are local and attending in person, the class will be offered on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday from 4-5 pm EST in Bressler Research Building Conference Room 7-035 (around the corner from the Flow Core).\nWe invite you to make whichever session best fits your schedule. If you have your own laptop, feel free to bring it. If you don’t have a laptop, please reach out, the Flow Core has 6 laptops running Linux that we can lend out to participants for use during the session.\nFor those who arrive early, we will have a limited number of second screens with provided mouse and keyboard that you can plug a laptop into via HDMI cable to set up a larger workstation. For those arriving later, the room has enough space (and electrical plugs) for up to 20 people, but you will need to balance a laptop on your lap.\n \n\n\nOnline (Worldwide)\n\nFor those joining us virtually, we will have three separate livestreams throughout the week on YouTube. These will be offered on:\n\nTuesday 2200 EST (Wednesday 0300 GMT+0)\nWednesday 1600 EST (Wednesday 2100 GMT+0)\nThursday 1000 EST (Thursday 1500 GMT+0)\n\n \n\n\nRecordings\n\nAll three livestreams will be recorded and available on YouTube immediately afterwards. Our plan is to eventually circle back after the course and properly edit them (ie. less minutes of random background noise, highlighting the relevant lines of code, time-stamps, subtitles, translations, etc.) later on as time allows, so that they can serve as a more permanent resource.   \n\n\nDiscussion Forum\n\nWe will be using our GitHub Discussions page as a community forum. This will allow us to answer questions, and benefit from insights from others in the community. One advantage of having so many people signed up for the course is that if you have a question, someone else likely does as well, so go start a post and ask it!\n \n\n\nOptional Take-Home Problems\n\nEach week, we will offer optional take-home problems. These are intended to allow you to work with your own data on similar problems, but in a not-so-structured manner. Challenges that you and overcome during the process will help grow your problem solving and debugging skills, and help solidify concepts covered during the course.\nTo get feedback on these problems, you can reach out to the community on the Discussions page, or once far enough open a pull request to the homework branch and we will provide additional feedback.\n \n\n\nCost\nIs there a cost to participate? No, it’s absolutely free! Is there a catch? Yes, you learn R, and may wind up with strong feelings about flowframes vs. cytoframes. This is also our first year offering this course, so we will sporadically ask you to fill out a feedback forms to help us improve.\n\n \n\n\nComputing Requirements\n\nFor those attending online, you will need a computer with internet access. Operating system shouldn’t matter, as we will be offering code examples for Windows, Mac and Linux. As with all things flow-cytometry software, having a faster CPU with multiple cores, more RAM and greater storage space is generally helpful, but not a deal breaker.\n\nYou will need to be able to install the required software (R, Rtools, Positron, Quarto, and Git) as well as install and compile R packages from the CRAN and Bioconductor repositories (as well as a few GitHub-based R packages). Installation walkthroughs for each computer operating system can be found here.\nFor those using university or company administered computers, please be aware that you may not have the necessary permissions to install these directly, and may need to reach out to your IT department to help get these initial requirements set up. If you are using your own computer, congratulations, you are your system administrator, and should already have the necessary permissions.\n\nFor those attending in-person, we have set up a pop-up computer lab in the conference room. For those who arrive early, we have a limited number of second screens with provided mouse and keyboard that you can plug a laptop into via HDMI cable to set up a workstation. For those arriving later, the room has enough space (and electrical plugs) for 20 people, but you will need to balance a laptop on your lap. If you have your own laptop, feel free to bring it. If you don’t have a laptop, the flow core has 6 loaner laptops running Linux that we can let participants use for that session.\n\n\n\n\nLicense\nIn our commitment to open-science and open-source, all teaching materials are freely offered under a CC-BY-SA license, while all code examples are offered under the AGPL3-0 copyleft license."

Then click on Open File(s).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom there, select your .fcs files of interest, and click Open.\n\n\n\nThe .fcs files will now load in, and you should see a view similar to the one below. On the left side-bar, you have your gating options (Rectangle, Polygon, Range, Elipse, Quad, etc). Next to these on the right you have the FCS files that are loaded into the workspace. Then on the right, you have the visual display for your selected specimen.\n\n\n\n\n\nSwitching Axis Markers\nIf you left click on the axis name (SSC-H or FSC-H in this case), you will be able to select other markers by which to gate your specimen. For the provided example, we were using a raw spectral flow cytometry .fcs file, so the names of the detectors are present.\n\n\n\nFor now, I plan to start off by gating for singlets. I switch the y-axis to FSC-H, and then proceed to switch the x-axis to FSC-A.\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating Gates\nWith this done, I can now select the Poly gate tab on the upper left.\n\n\n\nThen manually click on the locations on the plot to add the individual gate nodes.\n\n\n\nTo complete the gate, I click back to the original node point. At this point, the popup will allow you to name the gate.\n\n\n\nTo adjust the polygon gate, you can click on a node and drag it to expand or contract in a particular direction\n\n\n\nTo move the entire gate, first click on a node to select the gate, then click in the center of the gate to adjust its location.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Gates\nUnfortunately for those with the force-of-habit from using other softwares, double-clicking within the gate doesn’t do anything. To continue gating on the selected cells, you will need to click on the newly created gate name on the left. This will result in visualizing the isolated cells.\n\n\n\nOnce this is done, you can repeat the previous steps to change the axis markers and create a second gate. For this example, we went with a “Cells” gate to exclude debris from this particular sample.\n\n\n\nHaving created the “Cells” gate, we will be switching gating based on FSC and SSC to using the detector parameters.\nThe samples in this example were acquired to derive the cell counts and concentration of various cell populations within cryopreserved cord and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (CBMC and PBMC) specimens after thawing.\nThey were stained with CD19 BV421, CD45 PE, and CD14 APC on a 5-Laser Cytek Aurora, before unmixing, this would correspond respectively to V1, YG1/B4, R1/YG4 peaks respectively.\n\n\n\n\nScaling/Transformation\nWhen we switch the axis, we can see that the scaling/transformation is not ideal, as the staining and not-staining populations are scrunched up together in the center of the plot.\n\n\n\nTo change the scaling/transformation, we need to click directly on the axis.\n\n\n\nFrom there, when we click on the drop-down, we see the various transformation options. We will select Logicle, given we are working with spectral flow cytometry files.\n\n\n\nThis y-axis values are subsequently visualized with the logicle transformation applied, increasing our resolution between the positive and negative population.\n\n\n\nWe can then repeat this for the x-axis, adjusting the fine-tune options for the scaling as needed.\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigating Gating Hierarchy\nWith this done, let’s first draw a rectangle gate for the CD45+ (B4-A) cells.\n\n\n\nAnd then selecting that population by clicking on the gate name, let’s proceed and gate the CD19+ cells (V2-A).\n\n\n\nAs you can see, we now have the various gates present in the gating hierarchy for the respective .fcs file. To return to a previous gated population, we would click on the parent population above it.\n\n\n\nWe can subsequently add an additional gate at this gating level for the likely debris population (the threshold setting was suboptimal for this experimental run).\n\n\n\n\n\nCopying Gates\nThis was the process for gating for a single specimen. To copy gates over to the other specimens, we have two options. First, holding down your Ctrl (or equivalent) button, you can click on the individual gate names.\n\n\n\nFrom there, you can drag them down to the next specimen and apply them.\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can drag down the highlighted gated to the Pipelines Tab, and apply to All Files. This will result in the gates being copied to all specimens in the experiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjustments within Pipelines will carry over to all other respective unmodified specimens that share it’s gates.\n\n\n\nOnce this is done, I recommend cycling through the gates for each specimen, just to ensure that the gates were positioned correctly before saving the workspace.\n\n\n\n\n\nSaving Workspace\nWith everyone now “correctly” gated, we can proceed to save the workspace so that we can reopen it later from another browser.\nTo do this we open the File tab from the upper navigation bar, and select Save Workspace.\n\n\n\nFrom there we have a couple options, for now let’s select Floreada Workspace. Where it is saved at will depend on your individual browser settings, so watch for a popup.\n\n\n\nAlternatively (and crucially for the CytoML pipeline) we can also choose to save it as a FlowJo v10 .wsp file.\n\n\n\nIn both cases, you will end up with Workspace files that can be used later to access your created gates\n\n\n\n\n\nReopening Workspace\nTo reopen the Floreada workspace within the browser, reopen the website, and select the Open File(s) option.\n\n\n\nFrom there, select both the Floreada Workspace file as well as the .fcs files\n\n\n\nAt which point you will now be back to the point you last saved at.",

Yes, but we will take the workaround.\nSo, for anyone on Windows or MacOS, download FlowJo v10. Once installed, open the software, and close the login popups. Once there, open the Floreada created FlowJo.wsp file. Since you haven’t logged in, it won’t show any events. But it will correct the formatting bug. Close the software, and return to R. Your Floreada sourced .WSP file should now be readable by CytoML.\nOdd? For sure. Fixable? Likely, I will set a reminder to work with the Floreada and CytoML devs to see if we can cut out the need for this workaround.",

Since we are working in R, we will select the “R Project” option.\n\n\n\nWe will next be asked to name the new project folder and a storage location.\nOne thing I would like to remind everyone who is just starting to code is that it is best to avoid using special characters (ex. @ $ # ^ ! ; : ,) in any folder or file name. This is because when coding, these can be misinterpreted as commands.\nWhile spaces are generally okay, it is often to best stick to to stick to hyphens (-), underscores (_). We will explore naming conventions in more depth at a later time.\n\n\n\nAnother useful thing to know when getting started with version control, it is best to save your files within your local computer, avoid using OneDrive or other cloud storage options for the time reason. The reason behind is that permissions to write/save to the cloud locations can sometimes be quite finicky, and some autosave/indexing behaviors can cause issues. akes things easier to save or modify without running into permission issues. For most of our course examples, we will be saving our Project Folders under the Documents Folder.\nHaving named our new Project Folder, and designated a storage location, go ahead and check the Initialize Git Repository option. This will indicate to version control to monitor content and changes to files within this folder.\n\n\n\nThe next setup screen will verify which version of R you wish to use. Since we are just getting started, your most recent version of R (usually system) should work. We will also leave the “renv” (reproducible environment setup) option unchecked for the time being (we will revisit the concept later in the course).\n\n\n\nAnd if all goes well, we should see the “New Folder Created” popup.",

They contain a .yaml header, followed by a mix of regular written text (often explanations or other documentation), and sections (ie. chunks) that contain code. These are used when we are still getting the code to work, when we need to modify inputs frequently, or simply when we need to document what and why we are doing something to make life easier for our future-self two months from now.\n\n\n\nIn this example, I will go ahead and select the new file icon\n\n\n\nThenn I will name the file, and designate it as a Quarto Markdown file by adding the .qmd at the end of the name to denote the file type.",

For this example, we will also provide a “title:” and “format:” field for the time being (see additional options here).\n\n\n\n\n\nText\nWith a basic YAML formatting block now in place, we can build out other elements of our Quarto Markdown document. Unless otherwise specified, everything else in the document is assumed to be text, so I will go ahead and provide an initial text description of what I am trying to do.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode-Chunks\nHaving provided some initial text for documentation, we can then add code-block chunks to start writing some code.\nThe easiest way to do do this is to click the respective option on the upper-right of the Editor screen. Since Positron can handle multiple programming languages, so the chunk is inserted, we will need to select the language we use to be used within the code chunk (R in this case).\n\n\n\nYou will notice, that the inserted code block starts off with three backticks (`) and then “{r}”. The end of the code block is denoted by an additional three backticks.\nWe can also add new code blocks by simply typing these elements into the location we want to place a code chunk (as long as we are careful to add 3 backticks also at the end).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning Code\nNow that we have two code-chunks written, we can write lines of code within them. For this example, I will use two beginner friendly functions, print(“Hello”), which will print the contents contained between the ” ” to the console, and getwd() which will return the location of the folder you are working within (ie. the working directory).\nTo run/execute these lines of code, we have a couple options. We can click on the Run Cell option that appears on the upper-left side of the code chunk. Additionally, it has a companion option that will run all code chunks above it.\n\n\n\nWhen a code block is successfully run, you will see within the console (lower bottom of the screen) the line of code be run, with any returned outputs appear directly after.\n\n\n\nAn alternative to clicking the Run Cell button is to click on the line of code you are interested in running, then press (Ctrl + Enter)/(Command + Enter). This will execute the line of code that you have clicked on. This can be useful in scenarios where you want to run a specific line, and not the entire code-chunk.\n\n\n\nUsing this approach, you can see the location (ie. file path) of the current working directory was returned to the Console.",

The circle denotes unsaved changes, which we can correct by clicking on the Save Button to save the changes to our file.\n\n\n\n\nUntracked\nIf we turn our attention to the left primary sidebar, we can see that within our GitPractie folder there are three files, our Example.qmd, and the default README.md and .gitignore files. These all show up in green text with U’s to the right of the file names.\nThis denotes that the version control tracking software Git is currently considering them as “Untracked” files. While saving the document via the Save button means we will still have our changes when we reopen Positron, we won’t have any history of changes that we can use to revert back to the way all the files appeared at this exact point in time should something go wrong.\nWe will next go the address bar on the very far left, and select the Git tab.\n\n\n\nOn the Git tab, we can see that each of the three files are shown underneath a “Changes” drop-down. This contains the files that have undergone changes since the last commit. In our case, since we haven’t updated the save-state yet, this last commit would be the initial creation of the project folder.\n\n\n\nTo have version control track these individual files going forward, we can do so in two separate ways. We can add them individually by clicking the + symbol next to the individual names.\n\n\n\n\n\nStaged\nThis will result in the files being moved to the “Staged” dropdown. This denotes files being tracked with the intention of being recorded as the next save-state or waypoint (ie. a commit).\n\n\n\n\n\nCommit\nTo create a new commit (save-state or waypoint), once we have the files we want to track staged, we will write a commit message, and then press commit.\nA commit message is a brief description of the changes that have occurred to the files between this commit and the previous one. Make this short description informative enough that if you need to revert back in the future, you can quickly identify the commit you need to fall back to (more about this later).\n\n\n\nIf this your first time using version control, you will likely encounter the following pop-up asking that you provide a user.name and user.email. This is used to designate the author of the changes.If you get this popup, go ahead and select “Open Git Log”\n\n\n\n\n\nUserName and UserEmail\nThe Output tab at the bottom of the screen will open, showing the messages that led to the popup.\nThe important part to note is the commands that will be needed to provide your user name and email to the computer for authoring the commit. Typically, your email will be the same one you used for your GitHub account.\n\n\n\nFrom the displayed message, go ahead and copy\n“git config –global user.email”you@example.com””\nThen click on the adjacent terminal tab. You will paste the command in, but do not hit enter just yet.\nWindows users, please note, depending on your settings, if trying to paste from the keyboard into the terminal, you may need to press “Ctrl + Shift + V” instead of the usual “Ctrl + V”.\n\n\n\nWith the command now pasted (or typed), use your keyboard arrows to navigate to the email portion, and replace the generic email with your email address used for your GitHub account.\nMake sure that the quotation marks (“) around the email address remain present, as they help the computer identify where your email address starts and ends. Once satisfied that your email address is correct, press enter.\n\n\n\nNext up, repeat the process, this time copying over the command needed to set your user name to the terminal. Repeat the editing process to provide your name between the “” marks. Then press enter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Commit\nNow that your user.name and email address have been provided, Git should be able to provide an author to the commit message. Reattempt to press commit button.\nIf this is successful, you will see your initial commit appear on the bottom half of the left primary side bar, under the Graph dropdown. Congrats! Your files are now being tracked by version control.\n\n\n\nIf you hover with your mouse arrow just over the commit, you can see the longer commit message and additional details appear.\nIf you click on the commit tab, a new display will open in the editor, displaying the changes that occured in that commit compared to the previous one. In this case, since we added everything since the previous commit, nothing appears on the left side, while the entire documents contents appear highlighted in green on the right.\nGreen highlighting is used to show additions, while red highlighting is used to show deletions.\n\n\n\nHaving completed this initial commit, for this example, let’s imitate a typical workflow and make some additional changes to the file before we make a second commit. Within text portions of the .qmd file, use of # denotes a section header in markdown, so let’s add a header for Introduction and click save.\n\n\n\n\n\nModified\nWithin the left primary sidebar, we can see that the Git tracking has updated. Examples.qmd is visible once again. However, becuase it is now a tracked file, instead of showing up with the “U/Untracked” green highlight, it now appears as a brownish-red with a “M/Modified”.\nLet’s make an additional change to the .qmd file by adding another section (# Setup) and a code block with a commented out line (denoted by the # at the line start), before pressing Save.\n\n\n\nIf we were now to click on the Example.qmd file in the left primary sidebar, it will open the same kind of tracking display we saw previously. This time, we can see changes since our last commit. These appear as the green highlights along the scroll-bar, corresponding to the # Introduction and # Setup headers that we have added in since the last commit.\n\n\n\nFor a larger document, we can scroll down to see the various highlighted regions.\n\n\n\nWe could now repeat the steps showed above, staging the file, writing a commit message, and commiting again by clicking on the designated buttons.\nAn important question is how often should we commit, vs. just hit save? Well… it depends :D Let’s think about this in context of a video game. If you made commits at regular intervals throughout the day (or more frequently when doing something particularly risky), you are more likely to be close enough to a particular commit (waypoint/save-state) that you can quickly revert back to without loosing any progress. Alternatively, if your last commit was last week, you will not have any intermediate versions to fall back to.\n\n\nCommit via Terminal\nHaving demonstrated how to commit changes to Git via the left primary side-bar, for this second commit, let’s do it the alternate way via the terminal (tab on the panel at the bottom of your screen).\n\n\n\nAfter clicking on the terminal tab, click on blinking command line.\nThe command to stage a file is “git add”, followed by the name of the file you want to stage.\nIn this case, you would enter “git add Example.qmd” and press Enter. \n\n\nYou will see after pressing enter a new blank terminal line appear. If you glance at the left-sidebar, you can see that Example.qmd now appears under the Staged Changes dropdown.\n\n\n\nNext up, let’s write the git commit via the terminal. In this case, the command would be “git commit -m” (-m denoting message). The commit text is then surrounded by “” marks.\nFor example: “git commit -m”Added section headers to my QMD file””\nPress enter to save the commit.\n\n\n\nAnd you should see your second commit now appear in the left primary sidebar underneath the graphs dropdown.",

    "text": "Remote Version Control\n\nCopying Project Folder to GitHub\nWhile having local version control in place is helpful when you need to revert back after encountering issues, where Git shines is the ability to pass your changes to your online GitHub repository.\nNot only does this allow you to switch between computers, but should something disastrous happen to your main computer, you still have all your hard work backed up and readily assessible.\nFor this subsection, first, double check that Positron is still connected to your GitHub account by checking the user tab on the bottom-left. If not, repeat the connection setup.\n\n\n\nSince our project was created using the “New Folder from Template” option, it currently only exist locally. What we want to do next is to copy it to our GitHub account, creating a new repository in the process.\nTo do this, we will first need to install the usethis R package. Within your console, you would run the following line of code:\n\ninstall.packages(\"usethis\")\n\nDepending on what R packages you already have installed on your computer, you may get a prompt asking if you want to update/install additional dependencies. Go ahead and type the number corresponding to Update All, and press enter.\nThe package and all it’s dependencies should then install. If an error message appears, read through it, and follow provided instructions. Go to Discussions if need help.\n\n\nOnce the usethis package is installed, we need to activate it within R by calling it with the library command. This makes all the tools (ie. functions) within an R package available for use within Positron.\nIn your console, you would type:\n\nlibrary(usethis)\n\n\n\n\nWith library called, you now have access to the functions (tools) within the usethis R package. One of these is the use_github() function.\nIn Positron, if you hover over a function, it will pull up the associated help file which will provide you information about the arguments the function expects to receive, and what they do.\nFor use_github(), the main thing to remember for now is since this is a personal project being used for testing, we don’t necessarily want to share it with the entire world, so we should set the “private” argument equal to TRUE when creating a new repository.\n\n\n\nTaking this information that we have now gathered, we can now within our Quarto Markdown create a code chunk, write out the line of code calling the function, and providing the Private=TRUE argument within the ().\nWithin a code chunk, adding a # in front of a line of code, will comment it out, resulting in that line of code not being run. Since we have already installed the usethis package, and we don’t want to reinstall it every single time, let’s go ahead and comment out that line. Go ahead and press Enter.\n\n\n\nWe will see a message pop-up in the console. In this case, we had not saved before pressing enter, so there are uncommitted changes within the folder. The pop-up is asking whether you want to save these as well before sending the Folder to GitHub.\nIn this case I will chose to ignore the uncommitted changes by entering 3 (for Definitely) in the console and hitting enter on my keyboard.\n\n\n\nThe usethis R package will then execute the series of git commands that are needed to set up a GitHub repository (ie. the messages being displayed in the console window), and when finished will open a pop-up asking whether you want to see your new repository in your default Web Browser. I will go ahead and select yes in this case.\n\n\n\nAfter the browser opens, you can see that the elements I had staged and committed within Positron are now present within the GitHub repository. Since I had only staged Example.qmd, it is the only file that was backed up. We can also see the commit history online by clicking on the commit clock.\n\n\n\nAs we would expect, we only see our two commit messages. One important thing to note is the commit hash numbers, that denote a particular commit. If we decided to revert/fall back to a prior commit in the future, this would be the number we would need to provide to Git to return to that previous commit/save-state\n\n\n\nSimilarly, on GitHub, we have an option to Browse a Repository at a particular point in time. This will be quite useful later in the future when troubleshooting what major changes occurred between versions of an R package.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode Chunk Arguments\nHaving successfully connected our local Project Folder to a remote GitHub repository, let’s return to Positron.\nBefore continuing, if we left the code chunk that created the GitHub repository as is, every time we ran all code chunks in the document, it would try to recreate the GitHub repository. We don’t want this to happen, as the setup was a one-time operation.\nWhile we could add # in front of every line of code (or delete the code chunk entirely) it is often useful to have these set-up code chunks around to remind us what arguments we need to provide next time we need to a similar setup and are mind blanking on what to do.\nFortunately, Quarto allows us to set conditions on whether a chunk is run (ie. evaluated). We will discuss the conditiona arguments in more depth in the next section, but for now, we can modify the code chunk as follows.\nOn the next line after the {r}, we will add a hashtag (#), then a pipe (|), followed by a space. This is the setup for a code-chunk specific argument. We will then add “eval: FALSE”, which signals that the particular code-chunk should not be evaluated (ie, should not be run).\n\n\n\n\n\nREADME\nNow that we have connected our local Project Folder to GitHub, and have gotten a basic introduction to the “git add”, “git commit” arguments, let’s turn our focus to the other files currently listed as untracked by Git within our folder, the README.md and the .gitignore files.\nWhen setting up our GitHub account, we encounted an example of a README.md file. This file often provides a brief description of the project, and an outline of what the other files in the folder are for. As you may have gathered, even software developers are forgetful/under-caffenaited, and having notes to catch back up to speed is important.\n\n\n\n\n\n.gitignore\nWe additionally have a .gitignore file. Within a project, there are often some files that we will never want version control to track. These could be files that are too large for GitHub (ex. really large .fcs files), or files containing sensitive information (passwords, history, credentials, etc.).\nWhen the names of these file (or the file type shothand) are added to the .gitignore file, they are ignored by version control, and no longer appear on the primary left side bar.\n\n\n\nLet’s proceed and stage both the README.md and .gitignore file, so that changes to these files will be tracked. We can of course select both from the primary left side bar and write a short commit message.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr alternatively, if we want to stage all uncommitted files present in a single step, we could in the terminal use the “git add .”\nWe can then write our git commit using “git commit -m”.\nBoth approaches work, and you may switch between them based on preferrence.\n\n\n\nYou will notice after having committed, that if you look at the Graph dropdown on the bottom half of the primary left side-bar that something has changed.\nThere are now separate icons denoted as main and origin/main. These correspond to the last commit present locally (main), and the last commit on remote (ie. GitHub, origin/main).\nLocal is ahead since you just made the commit with the changes inactivating the code-chunk, and you have not passed these changes up to GitHub yet.\n\n\n\n\n\nPull\nBefore sending (ie. pushing up) our updated commit to GitHub, especially if you are working on a project from multiple computers (or as part of a team) to bring in (ie. pull down) any changes that might be on GitHub that are not present locally.\nThis ensures that everything is up to date, and you don’t end up with mismatched commits that are incompatible with each other and trigger an error message.\nTo pull in changes from GitHub, at the top of the primary left side-bar, you can select the … button to open a drop-down menu of Git options. You would then select “Pull”.\nAlternatively, you could do the same thing via the terminal by running the “git pull” command.\n\n\n\n\n\nPush\nIn our case, there was no new material present on our GitHub repository that were not already present locally, so all that is returned is the “Already up to date” message.\nWe are now good to proceed to push (ie. send) the updated commit up to our GitHub repository.\nWe can do this by either pressing the Sync changes button, or via the terminal entering the “git push” command.\n\n\n\nAnd now, if you glance down at left side-bar’s graph section, you will see that both the main and origin/main icons are now present for the most recent commit.\n\n\n\nIf we switch to our Web browser, we can see that this is also now the case for our GitHub repository that now also has the most recent changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nReverting to Prior Commit\nFor most daily-workflows, you will only need the git commands that we have introduced above (git add, commit, pull, push). The next two areas (reverting to a prior commit, and branches) are more specialized, and will be covered in greater depth later in the course. We are briefly covering them here. If you are at the point where your last remaining neuron has disconnected, and you feel you need to take a break from version control, feel free to skip to the next section and we will revisit these topics later in the course.\n\n–\nIn most cases, if your code stops working, you can identify the issue and fix it in the existing version, never needing to resort to reverting to a previous commit (save-state). The times you would need to revert would be if you deleted important files, or the new files are hopeless mess that is not worth trying to sort through. In those cases, reverting back might be better approach.\nTo imitate a falling back scenario, lets create and additional file, stage and commit it to end up a commit ahead of where we are currently at within the Project Folder.\n\n\n\nNow being one (or several) commits ahead, if we wanted to revert back, we would first need to identify the commit we want to revert back to and copy the commit hash number.\n\n\n\nThen, opening the terminal, we can enter “git reset” and paste the hash afterwards. We can then press enter.\n\n\n\nYou will notice our additional commit has been removed, although the newer files we were working on subsequent last commit are still present.\n\n\n\nIf however, we had wanted to return to the exact same state as the previous commit (removing all subsequent created files), we could do so by adding in the –hard argument. Before starting, save any newer files you want to keep in a completely different folder, because they will be permanently removed.\nThen, enter “git reset –hard thecommithashnumber” into the terminal, which would result in a “hard” return to the previous commits save-state. You may need to close and reopen Positron to see the changes reflected.\n\n\nBranches\nBranches are an useful Git feature that we will start using extensively later in the course. Branching allows you to create a parallel/carbon-copy of your existing repository, which you can then edit without affecting the main branch. This is particularly useful for projects that may get messy or drawn out. By isolating these edits to a parallel branch, if they don’t work, your main branch remains safe. Alternatively, if you like the changes that occurred in the branch, you can pull these changes from the branch back to main, bringing the timelines back together.\n\n\nWithin the terminal, entering “git branch” will show the existing branches. In this case, only main is present since we haven’t yet created a new branch.\n\n\n\nWe can create a new branch in the terminal by entering “git branch” followed by the name of our desired branch. In this case, we are creating a branch called Week1\n\n\n\nNow, when we check “git branch” again in the terminal, which returns the two branches, Week1 and main. The * is located next to main, indicating that we are currently within the main branch.\n\n\n\nBesides the terminal, we can also create a new branch via Positron. To do so, we first click on the Git tab in the Actions Bar.\nOnce the left-side bar displays the version control display, we can click on the … button (to the right of changes)to gain access to the Git options drop-down.\nFrom here, we click on Branch, and then select Create Branch.\n\n\n\nUsing Git branch, we saw that we were still within the main branch. In the terminal, we can switch over to the Week1 branch by using the “git checkout” command, followed by the branch we wish to switch to.\n\n\n\nThis results in us switching over to the Week1 branch.\n\n\n\nHaving switched (ie. checkout) to the Week 1 branch, let’s create the file BranchTest.qmd, which will exist within this branch, but not yet in the main branch.\n\n\n\nHaving created the file, let’s stage and then commit it. This will put the Week1 branch ahead of the main branch by a single commit.\n\n\n\nWith our changes staged and committed, if we look at the left side-bar’s graph section, our Week1 branch is now ahead of the origin/main branch by one commit.\n\n\n\nIf we were to check on GitHub, we can see that no new files are present on the main branch, but can see the notification listing recent changes to Week1 branch.\n\n\n\nUsing the drop-down, we can switch from displaying the main branch to the Week1 branch, where we can see the new file.\n\n\n\nIf we click the green compare and pull request button, we end up on this screen. This compares how the two branches are different from each other.\n\n\n\nWe will delve into branches again at a later point. For now, remember that by creating and prunning parallel branches, you can develop knowing that even if something goes wrong, your main branch remains safe.",

We are all human, at different points in our learning journeys, so what may be obvious to you at your point of your learning journey may have necessarily be obvious to someone just getting started. This course is our giving back to those in the community, but is on a voluntary basis in addition to our regular workload. While we try to reply quickly, sometimes our cell sorters fully melt down sending everything into chaos. We will reply when we can.\n\n\n\n\nAnnouncements\n\nWhen we send out an email to all participants, we will also repost it as an announcement. This ensures that even if you are not on our mailing list, you will still be able to have access to important information and course updates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral\n\nThis section category can be used for any discussions that you think are worth having, that don’t fall under any of the other category. Good examples are continuing a discussion that was held during one of the livestreams; wanting to discuss and dive further into a given week’s topic; or bringing in additional resources that you found useful to understandingn something that didn’t click initially. This space is for the community to shape as they see best.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdeas\n\nHave an idea for a new topic or a way to improve the course? We would love to hear them. Provide as many details, and ideally, an example, and if it is doable, we will try to implement them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroductions\n\nOnline courses can be odd in terms of replicating in-person dynamics. Fortunately, we have gathered the largest cohort of “cytometrist with no-to-little flow experience trying to learn R at the same time” that the world has ever seen, so best to take advantage of this while we can. Treat this section as if we had just met at a conference, tell us about yourself, what brings you here, and what you want to hopefully be able to do after the course ends.",

First thing before posting, search! to see if someone has already asked the question. If you don’t find anything, go ahead and open a new discussion.\nSince we are not at your computer, and don’t have your dataset, when troubleshooting it is best to include a minimal reproducible example of the issuen you are encountering, slimming down the number of files needed to be transferred, and generalizing down the code so that other course participants and instructors can follow along. If this is not doable, or if the problem requires added context (and larger files), create a new repository on your GitHub, make it public, and share the links to it in your post. The goal would be to download the folder and be able to replicate the issue that you are encountering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow and Tell\n\nWhere Q&A section is for getting help on code that is frustratingly not working, Show and Tell is where to go and celebrate when you finally get things to work.

This is the situation where opening an Issue is appropiate.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, if our code contains a wrong argument, is returning a deprecation warning, etc. open an issue to let us know. While we may not be able to fix something that is not directly related to our code, we can redirect it to the package maintainers so that they can fix the issue.\nAnd likewise, if you find multiple typos in the documentation, you can open an issue and propose carrying out a pull-request to fix them.",

Our goal is to provide you with the necessary code and enough code to be able to get the jist. However, to become comfortable and be able to apply what you have learned, you will need to explore beyond our examples, try it with your own datasets, encounter things that don’t work, and troubleshoot your way through them. It’s this cycle of venturing into the unknown that develops strong coding skills that are needed to overcome any barrier you encounter. The goal of the take-home questions is to provide some less curated problems that will take a little longer to answer to help get you started on your own exploration of the topic.\nAs previously mentioned, these take-home problems are completely optional. If you are in the middle of solving them and want to seek feedback from then community and course instructors, open a Discussion under the general category is the way to go.\nHowever, if you have completed them, and want course instructor feedback, you can submit them to us in the form of a pull-request to the CytometryInR repo’s homework branch. We will take a look, offer constructive suggestions, and when ready merge the solution. This will also result in GitHub listing you as a contributor to the course.\nWe will outline the basic steps of how to set up and open a pull-request, to help simplify the process.\n\nSync your Fork\nFirst off, make sure to Sync your fork of the Cytometry in R project. That makes sure that all the commits present are up-to-date and simplifies the process of having the pull-request being merged.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPull to Local\nHaving Synced your branch on GitHub, return to your computer, open the CytometryInR repository and pull in the changes locally.\n\n\n\n\nCreate own Folder under Homeworks\nUnder the course folder, you will find folders for each week. Within these folders find the homework folder. This will appear empty except for a README file with ionstructions. It is within this folder you will need to create your own folder.\nTo ensure there are no conflicts on the pull-request merge, please use your GitHub username as the folder name.\n\n\n\nOnce you have your folder inside homework, go ahead and copy anything you are turning in from their respective working project folders. Remember, the goal is minimal reproducible example is the goal. Rendered Quarto Documents are preferred, but we will also accept scripts and small data files and images. a README.MD file with anything you want me to know,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign off Commit\nNow that everything is present, Sign Off and Commit the change.\n\n\n\n\n\nPush Branch to GitHub.\nProceed to push the branch to GitHub.",

    "title": "Introduction to Quarto",
    "section": "Code Chunk Arguments",
    "text": "Code Chunk Arguments\nAs we briefly touched on in the last section, code-chunks can be modified by including arguments, which affect whether a particular code chunk gets evaluated. In that example, we included a “#| eval: FALSE” to the install commands since we did not want them to be re-run subsequently. We will take a closer look at the other arguments in this section.\n\nEval\nThe code-chunk argument, “Eval”, is used to determine when a code-chunk get’s evaluated. When set to true (or by default if no eval argument is included), the code-chunks contents will be run/executed, and the output will appear. We can see this in the html output, as below the code block, we get back the address of my working directory.\n\n\n\nWhen we switch the Eval argument to FALSE, and then render the document, we can see that the code block remains, but we do not get any output for the code contained within.\nIn every-day practice, we will “use eval: FALSE” arguments when we want to keep the code for later use, but want to manually run the code contained within ourselves.\n\n\n\n\n\nEcho\nThe code-block argument “echo” dictates whether the code within the code-block is displayed within the document. So in the case when “echo: true”, we get both the code displayed, as well as the output that gets returned by the code.\n\n\n\nBy contrast, when “echo: FALSE”, we do not have the code displayed, but do get the output of that code being run.\nIn daily-practice, “echo: FALSE” gets often used when generating plots that we want to include in the report, without the code that generated them being displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\nInclude\nThe next code-chunk argument is include. Unlike echo, which focuses on whether the code is displayed, but still returns the output, include dictates behavior of both the code-block and it’s output. Unlike eval however, it will still run the code, which allows it to be available for the next code-chunk that might need it. When we set “include: false”, no trace of that code-chunk is present in the document. This is useful when making reports where we do not want to include the code used to generate a particular figure.\n\n\n\nBy contrast, when we set “include: true”, the code block and it’s output is once again included within the rendered document.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode-Fold\nOne of my favorites is “code-fold”. When we set it as “code-fold: show”, it displays the code, but provides a drop-down arrow that can be closed to compress the code.\n\n\n\nIn contrast, if we want to make the code-available for those that are interested, but not directly visible, we can set as “code-fold: true”\n\n\n\n\n\nWarnings\nWithin R, when code is executed, in addition to returning the output, R is capable of returning warnings (when something is not as expected, but not sufficient to elicit an error with a complete stop) or a message (text output that gets displayed, often telling about progress). While these are useful when running code yourself, it can be annoying when generating a report and the 2nd page is a bunch of warning text being displayed.\nFor example, when the R package ggcyto is loaded via the library call, it will automatically load several other packages, which typically results in these messages being outputted:\n\n\n\nWe can therefore set that code-chunk’s warning/message arguments to FALSE, therefore silencing the message outputs that would otherwise clutter up our report.",

    "text": "Checking for Loaded Packages\nFor the contents (ie. the functions) of an R package to be available for your computer to use, they must first be activated (ie. loaded) into your local environment. We will first learn how to check what R packages are currently active.\n\n\n\nAccessing Help Documentation\nWithin your own index.qmd (or a new .qmd file that you created), type out/copy-paste the following sessionInfo() function:\n\nsessionInfo()\n\n\n\nIf you hover over the line of code within Positron, you will glimpse the help file for the particular function you are hovering over.\n\n\n\nIn this case, we can see the help documentation corresponding for sessionInfo(). Beyond hovering over the function, this can also be accessed by adding a ? directly in front of the function, and then running that line of code.\n\n?sessionInfo()\n\n\n\n\nWhen executed, the function’s help file documentation will open up within the Help tab in the secondary side bar on the right-side of the screen. Glancing at the top of the page we can see the name of the package that contains the sessionInfo() function ({utils}). Scrolling down the help page past all the documentation, we can see a link to the index page.\n\n\n\nAfter clicking, the Help tab switches from viewing the documentation for the sessionInfo() function, to showing all the functions within the utils package. Most R packages contain help documentation, so this process can be adapted to find out additional information about what a function does, and what arguments are needed to produce customized outputs.\n\n\n\n\n\nsessionInfo()\nWithin your .qmd file, let’s go ahead and run the following code-block:\n\nsessionInfo()\n\nR version 4.5.2 (2025-10-31)\nPlatform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu\nRunning under: Debian GNU/Linux 13 (trixie)\n\nMatrix products: default\nBLAS:   /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/blas/libblas.so.3.12.1 \nLAPACK: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/lapack/liblapack.so.3.12.1;  LAPACK version 3.12.0\n\nlocale:\n [1] LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8       LC_NUMERIC=C              \n [3] LC_TIME=en_US.UTF-8        LC_COLLATE=en_US.UTF-8    \n [5] LC_MONETARY=en_US.UTF-8    LC_MESSAGES=en_US.UTF-8   \n [7] LC_PAPER=en_US.UTF-8       LC_NAME=C                 \n [9] LC_ADDRESS=C               LC_TELEPHONE=C            \n[11] LC_MEASUREMENT=en_US.UTF-8 LC_IDENTIFICATION=C       \n\ntime zone: America/New_York\ntzcode source: system (glibc)\n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \n\nother attached packages:\n[1] BiocStyle_2.38.0\n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] htmlwidgets_1.6.4   BiocManager_1.30.27 compiler_4.5.2     \n [4] fastmap_1.2.0       cli_3.6.5           tools_4.5.2        \n [7] htmltools_0.5.9     otel_0.2.0          yaml_2.3.12        \n[10] rmarkdown_2.30      knitr_1.51          jsonlite_2.0.0     \n[13] xfun_0.56           digest_0.6.39       rlang_1.1.7        \n[16] evaluate_1.0.5     \n\n\n\n\nThe outputs that get returned by sessionInfo() will vary a bit depending on your computer’s operating system, and the version of R you have installed.\nFor today, let’s focus on the last two elements of the output:\n\n\n\nThe R software itself is made up of several base R packages, that are loaded automatically.

    "section": "Installing from CRAN",
    "text": "Installing from CRAN\nWe will start by installing R packages that are part of the CRAN repository. This is the main R package repository, being part of the broader R software project. In the context of this course, R packages that work primarily with general data structure (rows, columns, matrices, etc.) or visualizations will predominantly be found within this repository.\nThese include the tidyverse packages. These packages have collectively made R easier to use by smoothing out some of the rough edges of base R, which is why R has seen major growth within the last decade. We will be installing several of these R packages today.\n\n\n\ndplyr\nOur first R package we will install during this session is the dplyr package. Since it is hosted on the CRAN repository, to install it, we will need to use the CRAN-specific installation function install.packages().\n\n?install.packages()\n\n\n\n\nFor the install.packages() function, we place within the () the name of the R package from CRAN that we wish to install.\n\ninstall.packages(\"dplyr\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nA usual struggle point for beginners is that install.packages() requires ” ” to be placed around the package name. Forgetting them results in the error that we see below.\n\n\n\ninstall.packages(dplyr)\n\nError:\n! object 'dplyr' not found\n\n\n\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"dplyr\")\n\nGo ahead and click on “Run Cell” next to your code-block, to install the dplyr R package.\n\n\nWhen a package starts to install, you will see your console start to display text resembling that seen in the image below (varying a bit depending on your computers operating system).\n\n\n\nWithin this opening scrawl, you will see the location on your computer the R package is being installed to, as well as the file location for the R package being retrieved on CRAN.\nIf the package is successfully located, your computer will proceed to first download, then unpack (ie. unzip) it, before attempting to install to the target folder.\n\n\n\nThe final steps of the installation process involved various steps to verify everything was copied successfully, the help documentation assembled, and that the R package is capable of being loaded. If this is the case, you will see the “Done” line appear, as well as a mention where the original downloaded source package files has been stashed (usually a temp folder).\n\n\n\n\nAttaching packages via library()\nIf an R package has been installed successfully, we are now able to load it (ie. make it’s functions available) to our local environment using the library() function.\n\n?library()\n\n\n\nUnlike install.packages(), where we needed “” around the package name, the library() function does not require “” around the package name. Let’s go ahead and load in dplyr, making its respective functions to our local environment.\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\n\n\n\nFrom the output, we can see that dplyr has been attached. There are also a couple functions within dplyr that have identical names to functions within the stats and base packages. To avoid confusion, these 6 functions are masked, which is why we get the additional messages.\nWith dplyr now loaded via the library() call, let’s check sessionInfo() to see what has changed.\n\nsessionInfo()\n\nR version 4.5.2 (2025-10-31)\nPlatform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu\nRunning under: Debian GNU/Linux 13 (trixie)\n\nMatrix products: default\nBLAS:   /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/blas/libblas.so.3.12.1 \nLAPACK: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/lapack/liblapack.so.3.12.1;  LAPACK version 3.12.0\n\nlocale:\n [1] LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8       LC_NUMERIC=C              \n [3] LC_TIME=en_US.UTF-8        LC_COLLATE=en_US.UTF-8    \n [5] LC_MONETARY=en_US.UTF-8    LC_MESSAGES=en_US.UTF-8   \n [7] LC_PAPER=en_US.UTF-8       LC_NAME=C                 \n [9] LC_ADDRESS=C               LC_TELEPHONE=C            \n[11] LC_MEASUREMENT=en_US.UTF-8 LC_IDENTIFICATION=C       \n\ntime zone: America/New_York\ntzcode source: system (glibc)\n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \n\nother attached packages:\n[1] dplyr_1.2.0      BiocStyle_2.38.0\n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] digest_0.6.39       R6_2.6.1            fastmap_1.2.0      \n [4] tidyselect_1.2.1    xfun_0.56           magrittr_2.0.4     \n [7] glue_1.8.0          tibble_3.3.1        knitr_1.51         \n[10] pkgconfig_2.0.3     htmltools_0.5.9     generics_0.1.4     \n[13] rmarkdown_2.30      lifecycle_1.0.5     cli_3.6.5          \n[16] vctrs_0.7.1         compiler_4.5.2      tools_4.5.2        \n[19] evaluate_1.0.5      pillar_1.11.1       yaml_2.3.12        \n[22] otel_0.2.0          BiocManager_1.30.27 rlang_1.1.7        \n[25] jsonlite_2.0.0      htmlwidgets_1.6.4  \n\n\n\n\nSimilar to what was seen for the base R packages, dplyr is now attached. This means we should theoretically now have access to all its functions. We can verify this by seeing if we can look up the dplyr packages select() function and it’s respective help page.\n\n?select\n\n\n\n\nSince its parent package has been attached to our local environment (via the library() call), we can see dplyr functions appear as suggestions as we begin to type.\nBy contrast, is we check for the ggplot() function from the ggplot2 package (which we haven’t yet installed or attached via library()), no suggestions will pop up.\n\n?ggplot\n\nNo documentation for 'ggplot' in specified packages and libraries:\nyou could try '??ggplot'\n\n\n\n\nBeyond individual functions, some R packages also have help landing pages, that can be similarly accessed by adding a ? in front of the package name:\n\n\n\n\n\nUnattaching\nSo far, we have installed an R package, and then attached it (via library()). How would we reverse these steps?\nWell, to unload it from the local environment, there are a couple options. You could of course simply shut down Positron. The local environment only exist in context of when you open and close the session, which closing the program will do. All previously loaded R packages will be unattached, which is why when you start a new session you will need to load in all packages you plan on using via library().\nAlternatively, although less used, you could detach() it via your console:\n\ndetach(\"package:dplyr\", unload=TRUE)\n\n\nsessionInfo()\n\nR version 4.5.2 (2025-10-31)\nPlatform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu\nRunning under: Debian GNU/Linux 13 (trixie)\n\nMatrix products: default\nBLAS:   /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/blas/libblas.so.3.12.1 \nLAPACK: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/lapack/liblapack.so.3.12.1;  LAPACK version 3.12.0\n\nlocale:\n [1] LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8       LC_NUMERIC=C              \n [3] LC_TIME=en_US.UTF-8        LC_COLLATE=en_US.UTF-8    \n [5] LC_MONETARY=en_US.UTF-8    LC_MESSAGES=en_US.UTF-8   \n [7] LC_PAPER=en_US.UTF-8       LC_NAME=C                 \n [9] LC_ADDRESS=C               LC_TELEPHONE=C            \n[11] LC_MEASUREMENT=en_US.UTF-8 LC_IDENTIFICATION=C       \n\ntime zone: America/New_York\ntzcode source: system (glibc)\n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \n\nother attached packages:\n[1] BiocStyle_2.38.0\n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] digest_0.6.39       R6_2.6.1            fastmap_1.2.0      \n [4] tidyselect_1.2.1    xfun_0.56           magrittr_2.0.4     \n [7] glue_1.8.0          tibble_3.3.1        knitr_1.51         \n[10] pkgconfig_2.0.3     htmltools_0.5.9     generics_0.1.4     \n[13] rmarkdown_2.30      lifecycle_1.0.5     cli_3.6.5          \n[16] vctrs_0.7.1         compiler_4.5.2      tools_4.5.2        \n[19] evaluate_1.0.5      pillar_1.11.1       yaml_2.3.12        \n[22] otel_0.2.0          BiocManager_1.30.27 rlang_1.1.7        \n[25] jsonlite_2.0.0      htmlwidgets_1.6.4  \n\n\n\n\nLooking at the sessionInfo() output, dplyr is no longer attached to the local environment. Consequently, if we try to once again look for the documentation, no information will be retrieved.\n\n?dplyr\n\nNo documentation for 'dplyr' in specified packages and libraries:\nyou could try '??dplyr'\n\n\n\n\nThere is a workaround however, if we want to access functions from an unloaded R package. We can specify the R package’s name, followed by two :, and then the function name. The :: conveys the context to your computer that the package is present, but may not be attached.\n\n?dplyr::select()\n\nThis particular use case can be useful if we want to run a particular function, but not load in all a packages functions (which may have identical function names to other R packages we are using and cause some conflicts).\n\n\n\n\nRemoving Packages\nJust as we can install an R package, we can also uninstall an R package (although doing so is rare, most often when encountering package dependency conflict). To do so, we would use the remove.packages() function.\n\n?remove.packages()\n\n\nremove.packages(\"dplyr\")\n\nThis results in the package being removed entirely from our computer. We would then need to reinstall it if needed in the future.\n\n\n\n\nCommon Issues\nAs previously mentioned, CRAN is the main repository for R packages. But what if we tried to install an R package that is only found on Bioconductor or via GitHub using the install.packages() function?\nTo see what occurs, let’s try installing the PeacoQC package (which is found on Bioconductor).\n\ninstall.packages(\"PeacoQC\")\n\nInstalling package into '/home/david/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.5'\n(as 'lib' is unspecified)\n\n\nWarning: package 'PeacoQC' is not available for this version of R\n\nA version of this package for your version of R might be available elsewhere,\nsee the ideas at\nhttps://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-patched/R-admin.html#Installing-packages\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the initial warning message suggest that PeacoQC is not available for your version of R. When I first started trying to learn R on my own during COVID, this particular message was the bane of my existence and I couldn’t figure out what was going on.\nThis is just a default warning message, that would apply for both a package having a version mismatch, but also shown when trying to install packages that are not found on CRAN.",

    "text": "Installing from Bioconductor\nBioconductor is the second R package repository we will be working with throughout the course. While it contains far fewer packages than CRAN, it contains packages that are primarily used by the biomedical sciences. Following this link you can find it’s current flow and mass cytometry R packages.\nBioconductor R packages differ from CRAN R packages in a couple of ways. Bioconductor has different standards for acceptance than CRAN. They usually contain interoperable object-types, put more effort into documentation and continous testing to ensure that the R package remains functional across operating systems.\n\n\nTo install an R package that is located on Bioconductor, we first need to install the BiocManager package from CRAN. This package will allow us to install Bioconductor packages from their respective repository.\n\ninstall.packages(\"BiocManager\")\n\n\n\nOnce BiocManager is installed, we can attach it to our local environment using the library() function\n\nlibrary(BiocManager)\n\n\n\nWhen loaded, you will see an output showing the current Bioconductor and R versions.\nWe can then use BiocManager’s install() function to go back and install PeacoQC().\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAs always, don’t forget the “” when running an install() command.\n\n\n\n?install()\n\n\ninstall(\"PeacoQC\")\n\n\n\nWe see a similar opening sequence of installation steps as what we saw when installing the dplyr package from CRAN. However, in this case, several package dependencies (rjson, GlobalOptions, etc.) are present. Consequently, you can see these packages are also being downloaded from their respective repositories (either CRAN or Bioconductor), then unzipped and assembled before PeacoQC undergoes installation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBehind the scenes, within an R package, what package dependencies need to be installed are specified through the Description and Namespace files. If a package name is removed from these files, it will not be installed during the installation process\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin the scrawl of installation outputs, we can see individual dependencies undergoing installation similar to what we saw with dplyr, with a “Done (packagename)” being printed upon successful installation.\n\n\n\nThis process continues for each dependency being installed.\n\n\n\nAnd finally, once all the dependencies are installed, PeacoQC starts to install.\n\n\n\nOccasionally, during installation, you will see a pop-up windown like this one in the console. This let’s you know that some of the package dependencies have newer updated versions that are available to download. We are prompted to select between updating all, some or none. You will need to specify via the console how you want to proceed, by typing and entering one of the suggested options [a/s/n].\n\n\n\nAlternatively you may encounter a pop-up that resembles this one. Unlike the a/s/n output, we would need to provide a number for our intended choice. In this case, I went ahead and skipped all updates by typing 3 into the console, then hitting enter.\n\n\n\nGenerally, it’s okay to update if you have the time. Updates generally consist of minor improvements or bug fixes, that shouldn’t cause major issues. If you are short on time, you can go ahead and select skip the update by entering the value (n) for the none option.\n\n\n\nWith PeacoQC has been installed, we can load it via the library() call\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nRemeber, library() doesn’t require ” ”\n\n\n\nlibrary(PeacoQC)\n\n\n\nAnd we can check to see if it has been attached to the local environment\n\nsessionInfo()\n\nR version 4.5.2 (2025-10-31)\nPlatform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu\nRunning under: Debian GNU/Linux 13 (trixie)\n\nMatrix products: default\nBLAS:   /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/blas/libblas.so.3.12.1 \nLAPACK: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/lapack/liblapack.so.3.12.1;  LAPACK version 3.12.0\n\nlocale:\n [1] LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8       LC_NUMERIC=C              \n [3] LC_TIME=en_US.UTF-8        LC_COLLATE=en_US.UTF-8    \n [5] LC_MONETARY=en_US.UTF-8    LC_MESSAGES=en_US.UTF-8   \n [7] LC_PAPER=en_US.UTF-8       LC_NAME=C                 \n [9] LC_ADDRESS=C               LC_TELEPHONE=C            \n[11] LC_MEASUREMENT=en_US.UTF-8 LC_IDENTIFICATION=C       \n\ntime zone: America/New_York\ntzcode source: system (glibc)\n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \n\nother attached packages:\n[1] PeacoQC_1.20.0      BiocManager_1.30.27 BiocStyle_2.38.0   \n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] generics_0.1.4        shape_1.4.6.1         digest_0.6.39        \n [4] magrittr_2.0.4        evaluate_1.0.5        grid_4.5.2           \n [7] RColorBrewer_1.1-3    iterators_1.0.14      circlize_0.4.17      \n[10] fastmap_1.2.0         foreach_1.5.2         doParallel_1.0.17    \n[13] jsonlite_2.0.0        graph_1.88.1          GlobalOptions_0.1.3  \n[16] ComplexHeatmap_2.26.0 flowWorkspace_4.22.1  scales_1.4.0         \n[19] XML_3.99-0.20         Rgraphviz_2.54.0      codetools_0.2-20     \n[22] cli_3.6.5             RProtoBufLib_2.22.0   rlang_1.1.7          \n[25] crayon_1.5.3          Biobase_2.70.0        yaml_2.3.12          \n[28] otel_0.2.0            cytolib_2.22.0        ncdfFlow_2.56.0      \n[31] tools_4.5.2           parallel_4.5.2        dplyr_1.2.0          \n[34] colorspace_2.1-2      ggplot2_4.0.1         GetoptLong_1.1.0     \n[37] BiocGenerics_0.56.0   vctrs_0.7.1           R6_2.6.1             \n[40] png_0.1-8             matrixStats_1.5.0     stats4_4.5.2         \n[43] lifecycle_1.0.5       flowCore_2.22.1       S4Vectors_0.48.0     \n[46] htmlwidgets_1.6.4     IRanges_2.44.0        clue_0.3-66          \n[49] cluster_2.1.8.1       pkgconfig_2.0.3       pillar_1.11.1        \n[52] gtable_0.3.6          data.table_1.18.2.1   glue_1.8.0           \n[55] xfun_0.56             tibble_3.3.1          tidyselect_1.2.1     \n[58] knitr_1.51            farver_2.1.2          rjson_0.2.23         \n[61] htmltools_0.5.9       rmarkdown_2.30        compiler_4.5.2       \n[64] S7_0.2.1             \n\n\n\n\nAs you may have noticed, the section of loaded via namespace (but not attached) packages has grown larger.

Newer packages that are still being worked on (often in the process of submission to CRAN or Bioconductor) can be found here, as well as those where the author decided not to bother with a review process, and just made the packages immediately available, warts and all.\n\n\nWhile many gems of R packages can be found on GitHub, there are also a bunch of R packages that due to deprecation since when they were published and released have stopped working. This is often the case for R packages that are not maintained, which is why it’s useful to check the commits and issues pages to see when the last contribution occurred. We will take a closer look at how to do so later on.\n\n\nTo install packages from GitHub, you will need the remotes package, which can be found on CRAN.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpot Check #1\n\n\n\nTo install a package from CRAN, what function would you use? Click on the code-fold arrow below to reveal the answer.\n\n\n\n\nCode\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")\n\n\n\n\nWith the remotes package now installed, we can attach it to our local environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpot Check #2\n\n\n\nWhat function would be used to do so?\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(remotes)\n\n\n\n\nAnd finally, we can use the install_github() function to download R packages from the invidual developers GitHub account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpot Check #3\n\n\n\nHow would you look up the help documentation for this function?\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Either by hovering over it within Positron or via\n\n?install_github()\n\n\n\n\nWe will be installing a small R package flowSpectrum for this example. It’s one of the packages created by Christopher Hall, whose small series of Flow Cytometry Data Analysis in R tutorials were immensely useful when I was first getting started learning R. flowSpectrum can be used to generate spectrum-style plots for spectral flow cytometry data.\n\n\n\nTo install an R package from GitHub, we first need the GitHub username (so hally166 in this case), which is followed by a “/”, and then the name of the package repository (so flowSpectrum in this case). Our code should consequently be:\n\ninstall_github(\"hally166/flowSpectrum\")\n\n\n\nWhen installing from GitHub, the opening installation scrawl will look different. Unlike R packages from CRAN or Bioconductor, which are usually shipped in an assembled binary format, R packages from GitHub start off as source code. So the first steps shown in the scrawl are the process of converting them to binary before proceeding.\nThis process of building R packages from source code is one of the reasons we needed to install Rtools (for Windows users) or Xcode Developer Tools (for MacOS) for this course. We will look at this topic in greater depth later in the course when we talk about creating R packages.",

    "text": "Troubleshooting Install Errors\nWe have now installed three R packages, dplyr, PeacoQC, and flowSpectrum. In my case, I did not encounter any errors during the installation. However, sometimes a package installation will fail due to an error encountered during the installation process. This can be due to a number of reasons, ranging from a missing dependency, or an update that caused a conflict. While these can occur for CRAN or Bioconductor packages, they are more frequently seen for GitHub packages where the Description/Namespace files may not have been fully updated yet to install all the required dependencies.\nWhen encountering an error, start of by first reading through the message to see if you can parse any useful information about what package failed to install, and if it list the missing dependency packages name. The later was the case in the error message example shown below.\n\n\n\nIf you encounter an installation error this week, please take screenshots of the error message and post them to this Discussion. This will help us troubleshoot your installation, as well as provide additional examples of installation errors that will be used to update this section in the future.",

    "text": "Installing Specific-Package Versions\nWhile we may be tempted to think of R packages as static, they change quite often, as their develipers add new features, fix bugs, etc. To help keep track of these changes (essential for reproducibility and replicability), R packages have version numbers.\nWhen we run sessionInfo(), we can see an example of this, with the version number appearing after the package name.\n\nsessionInfo()\n\nR version 4.5.2 (2025-10-31)\nPlatform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu\nRunning under: Debian GNU/Linux 13 (trixie)\n\nMatrix products: default\nBLAS:   /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/blas/libblas.so.3.12.1 \nLAPACK: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/lapack/liblapack.so.3.12.1;  LAPACK version 3.12.0\n\nlocale:\n [1] LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8       LC_NUMERIC=C              \n [3] LC_TIME=en_US.UTF-8        LC_COLLATE=en_US.UTF-8    \n [5] LC_MONETARY=en_US.UTF-8    LC_MESSAGES=en_US.UTF-8   \n [7] LC_PAPER=en_US.UTF-8       LC_NAME=C                 \n [9] LC_ADDRESS=C               LC_TELEPHONE=C            \n[11] LC_MEASUREMENT=en_US.UTF-8 LC_IDENTIFICATION=C       \n\ntime zone: America/New_York\ntzcode source: system (glibc)\n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \n\nother attached packages:\n[1] PeacoQC_1.20.0      BiocManager_1.30.27 BiocStyle_2.38.0   \n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] generics_0.1.4        shape_1.4.6.1         digest_0.6.39        \n [4] magrittr_2.0.4        evaluate_1.0.5        grid_4.5.2           \n [7] RColorBrewer_1.1-3    iterators_1.0.14      circlize_0.4.17      \n[10] fastmap_1.2.0         foreach_1.5.2         doParallel_1.0.17    \n[13] jsonlite_2.0.0        graph_1.88.1          GlobalOptions_0.1.3  \n[16] ComplexHeatmap_2.26.0 flowWorkspace_4.22.1  scales_1.4.0         \n[19] XML_3.99-0.20         Rgraphviz_2.54.0      codetools_0.2-20     \n[22] cli_3.6.5             RProtoBufLib_2.22.0   rlang_1.1.7          \n[25] crayon_1.5.3          Biobase_2.70.0        yaml_2.3.12          \n[28] otel_0.2.0            cytolib_2.22.0        ncdfFlow_2.56.0      \n[31] tools_4.5.2           parallel_4.5.2        dplyr_1.2.0          \n[34] colorspace_2.1-2      ggplot2_4.0.1         GetoptLong_1.1.0     \n[37] BiocGenerics_0.56.0   vctrs_0.7.1           R6_2.6.1             \n[40] png_0.1-8             matrixStats_1.5.0     stats4_4.5.2         \n[43] lifecycle_1.0.5       flowCore_2.22.1       S4Vectors_0.48.0     \n[46] htmlwidgets_1.6.4     IRanges_2.44.0        clue_0.3-66          \n[49] cluster_2.1.8.1       pkgconfig_2.0.3       pillar_1.11.1        \n[52] gtable_0.3.6          data.table_1.18.2.1   glue_1.8.0           \n[55] xfun_0.56             tibble_3.3.1          tidyselect_1.2.1     \n[58] knitr_1.51            farver_2.1.2          rjson_0.2.23         \n[61] htmltools_0.5.9       rmarkdown_2.30        compiler_4.5.2       \n[64] S7_0.2.1             \n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we can retrieve the same information for the individual packages via the packageVersion() function\n\npackageVersion(\"PeacoQC\")\n\n[1] '1.20.0'\n\n\n\n\nAs well as from the citation() function.\n\ncitation(\"PeacoQC\")\n\nTo cite package 'PeacoQC' in publications use:\n\n  Emmaneel A (2025). _PeacoQC: Peak-based selection of high quality\n  cytometry data_. doi:10.18129/B9.bioc.PeacoQC\n  &lt;https://doi.org/10.18129/B9.bioc.PeacoQC&gt;, R package version 1.20.0,\n  &lt;https://bioconductor.org/packages/PeacoQC&gt;.\n\nA BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is\n\n  @Manual{,\n    title = {PeacoQC: Peak-based selection of high quality cytometry data},\n    author = {Annelies Emmaneel},\n    year = {2025},\n    note = {R package version 1.20.0},\n    url = {https://bioconductor.org/packages/PeacoQC},\n    doi = {10.18129/B9.bioc.PeacoQC},\n  }\n\n\n\n\nHow does a version number work? Lets say we have the following version number: 1.20.0\nThe first number of the version (1. in this case) denotes major changes, primarily those where after the version change the package may not be compatible with the code used in the prior version. As a consequence, this number changes rarely.\nThe second number (.20. in this case) is the minor version. Minor changes typically consist of new features that are added, that don’t affect the overall package function. These will change more frequently, especially for Bioconductor packages with fixed release cycles.\nThe final number (.0 in this case) is often used to denote small changes occuring within a minor release period, often bug-fixes or fixing typos within the documentation.\n\n\nWe may in the future need to install specific package versions (but wont be doing so today). As expected, which repository contains the R package influences how we would go about doing this.\nFor CRAN packages, we can use the remotes packages install_version() function. This allows us to provide the version number, and designate the repository location (the CRAN url in this case).\n\nremotes::install_version(\"ggplot2\", version = \"3.5.2\", repos = \"https://cloud.r-project.org\")\n\nFor GitHub-based R packages, the package versioning schema is not as strict as that of CRAN or Bioconductor. Typically, changes in R packagaes are put out by their developers as releases. When trying to install a particular release, we can add an additional argument to the install_github() function, specifying the release version’s tag number. For example:\n\nremotes::install_github(\"DavidRach/Luciernaga\", ref = \"v0.99.7\")\n\nAlternatively, if the developer doesn’t implement releases, you can provide the hash number of a particular commit.\n\nremotes::install_github(\"DavidRach/Luciernaga\", ref = \"8d1d694\")",

    "text": "Documentation and Websites\nWe have already seen a couple ways to access the help documentation contained within an R package via Positron. Beyond internal documentation, R packages often have external websites that contain additional walk-through articles (ie. vignettes) to better document how to use the package.\nFor CRAN-based packages, we can start off by searching for the package name. So, in the case of dplyr:\n\n\n\nTwo main suggestions pop up. One is the package’s CRAN page. Unfortunately, this one is not particularly user-friendly, although some text-based vignettes are accessible.\n\n\n\nBecause of this, many CRAN-based R packages (especially those part of the tidyverse) use pkgdown-generated websites hosted via a GitHub page (similar to the one used by this course. The second option on the search is dplyr’s pkgdown-style website\n\n\n\nWe can usually find the list of functions under the Reference tab, with the more extensive documentation vignettes being found under the Articles tab.\n\n\n\nGitHub-based packages will vary depending on their individual developers, but often will also use pkgdown-style websites. These often appear as links on the right-hand side, or within the repository’s ReadMe.\n\n\n\nFor Bioconductor-based packages, on the package’s page we can typically find the already rendered vignette articles, usually as either html or pdf files. For example, with PeacoQC:\n\n\n\nAdditionally, package vignettes can also be reached via the packages help index page.
